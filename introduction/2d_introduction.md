1. **Introduction**
	1. Overview of paper
		- clinical/preclinical evidence for mechanisms of brain-heart interaction in stress disorders
		- neurological, psychiatric, genetic influences on autonomic dysfunction, atherosclerosis, ischemia
		- stress disorders including clinical (PD, PTSD, GAD, SAD, MDD) and allostatic load have relationship with cardiovascular risk
	1. Epidemiology studies
		- observational studies show that psychosocial stress, arousal, depression precipitate SCD [@Greene1972; @Rahe1973; @Mittleman1995]
	1. Neurophysiology 
		1. Neurocardiac axis 
			- description of anatomical pathways (medullary, supramedullary, intrathoracic extracardiac ganglia, intrinsic cardiac ganglia, spinal columns) [@Armour2008; @Oppenheimer1992]
			- importance of sympathetic tone through stellate ganglion for increasing risk of VF [@Kliks1975; @Schwartz1977a; @Harris1971], and that of vagal activity as protective [@Kolman1975; @Rabinowitz1976; @Ng2001; @Brack2007; @Brack2011; @Coote2013]
		1. Arrhythmia studies
			- brain stimulation by chemical/electrical stimuli lead to VF [@Levy1914; @Lown1977]; threshold lowered with ischemia [@Kolman1975]; dysrhythmia mediated potentially through catecholamines [@Davis1993]
			- psychological stress can also lead to fibrillation [@Lown1973]
