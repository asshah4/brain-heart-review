# Mental stress induced ischemia

Acute psychological stress has been shown to induce myocardial ischemia,[@Schoder2000; @Schoder2000a; @Arrighi2000; @Lacy1995; @Hammadah2017a] however, the mechanisms remain unclear. Mental stress induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) may be mediated not only through inflammatory pathways,[@Hammadah2018a] but also through stress-induced vasoconstriction. In patients that develop MSIMI, there is an increased activation to stress in the anterior cingulate, inferior frontal gyrus, and parietal cortex during public speaking, with additional activity in the left insula during arithmetic stress.[@Bremner2018] MSIMI can be induced by anger and is more prevalent in patients that have symptomatic angina,[@Pimple2015; @Pimple2015a; @Pimple2018] suggesting the important role of coronary vasomotor function in the induction of mental stress. Not only does mental stress lead to coronary vasoconstriction, but have an impact on hemodynamic response as well.[@Sullivan2018a; @Vaccarino2014; @Vaccarino2016a] The mechanism underlying coronary vasoconstriction to mental stress, which is partially mediated by neuronal nitric oxide synthase,[@Khan2017]  may also be similar to the peripheral microvascular response as similar cortical regions, including the insula and parietal cortex, and may share the same autonomic substrate.[@Hammadah2018; @Shah2018]
