abstract = {Depression's burden of disease goes beyond functioning and quality of life and extends to somatic health. Results from longitudinal cohort studies converge in illustrating that major depressive disorder (MDD) subsequently increases the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality with about 80%. The impact of MDD on cardiovascular health may be partly explained by mediating mechanisms such as unhealthy lifestyle (smoking, excessive alcohol use, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, therapy non-compliance) and unfavorable pathophysiological disturbances (autonomic, HPA-axis, metabolic and immuno-inflammatory dysregulations). A summary of the literature findings as well as relevant results from the large-scale Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (N = 2981) are presented. Persons with MDD have significantly worse lifestyles as well as more pathophysiological disturbances as compared to healthy controls. Some of these differences seem to be specific for (typical versus ‘atypical', or antidepressant treated versus drug-naive) subgroups of MDD patients. Alternative explanations are also present, namely undetected confounding, iatrogenic effects or ‘third factors' such as genetics.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Co-morbidity between depression and anxiety disorders is common. In this study we define a quantitative measure of anxiety by summating four anxiety items from the SCAN interview in a large collection of major depression (MDD) cases to identify genes contributing to this complex phenotype.\n\nMETHODS: A total of 1522 MDD cases dichotomised according to those with at least one anxiety item scored (n = 1080) and those without anxiety (n = 442) were analysed, and also compared to 1588 healthy controls at a genome-wide level, to identify genes that may contribute to anxiety in MDD.\n\nRESULTS: For the quantitative trait, suggestive evidence of association was detected for two SNPs, and for the dichotomous anxiety present/absent ratings for three SNPs at genome-wide level. In the genome-wide analysis of MDD cases with co-morbid anxiety and healthy controls, two SNPs attained P values of < 5 × 10⁻⁶. Analysing candidate genes, P values ≤ 0.0005 were found with three SNPs for the quantitative trait and three SNPs for the dichotomous trait.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides an initial genome-wide assessment of possible genetic contribution to anxiety in MDD. Although suggestive evidence of association was found for several SNPs, our findings suggest that there are no common variants strongly associated with anxious depression.},

abstract = {The monoaminergic innervation of the coronary vessels and myocardium in the dog was studied by means of the histochemical fluorescence method. The distribution of monoaminergic terminals in the arterial wall depends on the diameter of the artery. In large arteries, the terminals are regularly distributed around the entire circumference, the fibres being situated between the elastic lamellae of the adventitia. The terminals within the media could not be detected. In small arteries, the sympathetic ground plexus aggregates in two parallel strands, the artery being between them. In arterioles, two thick fibres only accompany the vellel. The myocardium is innervated by means of a three-dimensional sympathetic ground plexus distributed between the myocardial cells independently of vessels. No difference in density of innervation was found between the right and left heart. The point-counting method, on the other hand, has revealed that the density of innervation in the left auricle is nearly twice as dense as in the left ventricle. The terminals innervating the myocardium are markedly thinner than the fibres innervating the arteries. Two-dimensional plexuses innervate the epicardium, endocardium and valves.},

abstract = {The effect of psychologic stress on cardiac vulnerability was examined in 10 conscious dogs. The repetitive extrasystole threshold wasemployed as a measure of susceptibility to ventricular fibrillation. Instrumental aversive conditioning constituted a stressful environment. The repetitive extrasystole threshold decreased by nearly 50 percent during 3 days in which the animals were exposed to the stressful environment. When Tolamolol hydrochloride, a cardioselective beta adrenoceptor blocking agent, was administered before a stress session, the repetitive extra-systole threshold was unaltered from the control value. Thus, stress-evoked changes in cardiac vulnerabilityare mediated through the sympathetic nervous system. The role of psychologic stress in predisposing to cardiac arrhythmias is well recognized clinically. However, precise data documenting this relation have been difficult to obtain in man or in the animal laboratory. With growing interest in the problem of sudden death due to ventricular fibrillation, attention has been devoted to alterations in ventricular vulnerability during various stressful states. Recently it has been demonstrated in dogs that the threshold of the ventricular vulnerable period for eliciting repetitive extrasystoles is significantly lower in an aversive than in a placid environment. 1 It has also been found that animals placed in stressful restraint after myocardial infarction experience ventricular arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia. 2 In pigs protected against psychologic stress, the onset of ventricular fibrillation after coronary arterial ligation is either retarded or entirely prevented, u Moreover, pharmacologically restrained pigs subjected to electrical stimulation undergo severe acute cardiomyopathy and 13 percent die suddenly. 4 This study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of psychologic stress upon ventricular electrical stability in the conscious dog. The assumption entertained was that a change in cardiac electrical stability was associated with increased susceptibility to ventricular fibrillation. 5 The underlying hypothesis was that a psychologically stressful environment would increase cardiac electrical instability. Instrumental aversive conditioning was the experimental paradigm employed to produce psychologic stress. 6-s Since certain types of stressors in man affect cardiac function through sympathetic nervous mediation, 9 these studies were performed with and without blockade of beta adrenergic activity. Cardiac electrical stability was determined by measuring the threshold current necessary to provoke repetitive ventricular extrasystoles. It has been demonstrated that the repetitive extrasystole threshold can be used as a precise measure of the vulnerable period threshold for ventricular fibrillation.I, lo Methods Ten mongrel dogs, weighing 8.5 to 17 kg, were anesthetized with intravenously administered sodium pentobarbital, 32.5 mg/kg body weight.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine prospectively early-age heart disease (HD) among a national random sample of 4328 male Vietnam veterans, who did not have HD at baseline in 1985. Studies have suggested that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may result in cardiovascular disease. However, many past studies had important methodological limitations to their designs.\n\nMETHOD: Using Cox regressions, we assessed PTSD, age, race, intelligence, family history, obesity, smoking, alcohol abuse, antisocial personality, and depression in predicting HD mortality at follow-up in December 31, 2000. The men were <65 years old at follow-up.\n\nRESULTS: Using two PTSD measures, a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd Edition (DSM-III) measure (D-PTSD) and one developed by Keane (K-PTSD), we found that among Vietnam theater and era veterans combined (era veterans had no Vietnam service), having PTSD was associated with HD mortality for D-PTSD (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.25, p = .045) and approached significance for K-PTSD (HR = 2.16, p = .066). However, having higher PTSD symptoms on either scale was associated with mortality, with a 5-point increase associated with approximately 20% increase in mortality risk (all p < .05). Controlling for lifetime depression only slightly altered the results. The effects for theater veterans alone were stronger (D-PTSD: HR = 2.58, p = .025; K-PTSD: HR = 2.73, p = .022). Among theater veterans, controlling for lifetime depression or combat exposure made little difference.\n\nCONCLUSION: PTSD was prospectively associated with HD mortality among veterans free of HD at baseline. This study suggests that early-age HD may be an outcome after military service among PTSD-positive veterans.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND\nCentral venous catheters are devices used for therapeutic, diagnostic, and monitoring purposes. Complications associated with central venous catheter use include those related to their insertion, rupture and displacement of the catheter, occlusion, thrombosis, and infection. Of these the latter is important due to the high morbidity and mortality it causes in the patients, and total parenteral nutrition increases the risk. The aim of this study is determine the incidence and risk factors associated with catheter-related infection in patients on parenteral nutrition. \n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nA retrospective, observational, and cross-sectional study was conducted, by analysing patients on total parenteral nutrition who developed a catheter-related infection in a 6-month period. Multiple variables were studied, looking for significance. A statistically significant relationship was considered with a p<0.05. \n\nRESULTS\nThe study consisted of 85 patients, of whom 52% were women and 48% men. The median age was 54 years. The most frequent diagnosis was enterocutaneous fistula. Catheter associated infection was present in 19% of patients. The most frequent microorganisms found were Staphyloccocus sp. (44%) and Candida sp. (25%). Median time between central venous catheter insertion and infection was 78±64 days. There was a significance between days with a central venous catheters and infection development (p=0.014). Infection developed in 81% of patients on whom surgery was performed (p<0.05). \n\nCONCLUSION\nIt was found that patients with a longer use of a central venous catheter (p=0.014) and those who were operated on in conjunction with total parenteral nutrition (p<0.05) were more prone to develop a catheter-associated infection. \n\nANTECEDENTES\nLos cat{\'{e}}teres vasculares centrales son dispositivos que permiten el acceso al torrente sangu{\'{i}}neo con fines diagn{\'{o}}sticos, terap{\'{e}}uticos y de monitorizaci{\'{o}}n.

abstract = {Depression increases the risk of cardiac mortality and morbidity in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), but the mechanisms that underlie this association remain unclear. This review considers the evidence for several behavioral and physiological mechanisms that might explain how depression increases the risk for incident coronary disease and for subsequent cardiac morbidity and mortality. The candidate mechanisms include: (1) antidepressant cardiotoxicity; (2) association of depression with cardiac risk factor such as cigarette smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and reduced functional capacity; (3) association of depression with greater coronary disease severity; (4) nonadherence to cardiac prevention and treatment regimens; (5) lower heart rate variability (HRV) reflecting altered cardiac autonomic tone; (6) increased platelet aggregation; and (7) inflammatory processes. Despite recent advances in our understanding of these potential mechanisms, further research is needed to determine how depression increases risk for cardiac morbidity and mortality. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Various cardiovascular receptors were stimulated during reflex inhibition of the central inspiratory neurones produced by electrical stimulation of both superior laryngeal nerves simultaneously, while the afferent input from the lungs was held constant by temporarily interrupting artificial respiration, the lungs being held static in their expiratory position. 3. Reflex cardioinhibitory responses were elicited by stimulation of (a) the carotid body chemoreceptors by intracarotid injections of cyanide; (b) the arterial baroreflex by controlled elevations of the blood pressure; (c) the carotid sinus baroreceptors by raising the pressure in isolated perfused carotid sinus preparations; (d) cardiac receptors by left atrial injections of veratridine, and (e) pulmonary C fibres (including J receptors) by right atrial injections of phenyl biguanide. 4. The effects of single inflations of the lungs on these reflex cardioinhibitory responses were studied and compared with the effects of the various inputs alone. 5. Stepwise increases in lung volume, while having no consistent effect on arterial blood pressure, progressively diminished the arterial chemoreceptor-induced bradycardia to a value of about 7% of the control response without lung inflation. The pulmonary afferents were less effective on reflex responses from other inputs, the corresponding values being: arterial baroreflex, 66%; carotid baroreceptors, 66%, and cardiac receptors, 70%. These effects of lung inflation were abolished by selective denervation of the lungs. 6. In contrast, the size of the bradycardia evoked by pulmonary C fibre stimulation was, on average, unaffected by inflation of the lungs. In some tests the response was actually increased. 7. The differential modulation by lung inflation of these reflex cardioinhibitory responses were the same after upper thoracic sympathectomy indicating that pulmonary afferents and cardiac efferents involved fibres in the vagus nerves. 8.

Seven variants associated with CHD were initially identified, and 5 SNPs were later found in replication studies. In the current study, the authors aimed to determine whether the 12 SNPs reported by the WTCCC predicted incident CHD through 2004 in a biracial, prospective cohort study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) comprising 15,792 persons aged 45-64 years who had been selected by probability sampling from 4 different US communities in 1987-1989. Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for age and gender were used to estimate CHD hazard rate ratios (HRRs) over a 17-year period (1,362 cases in whites and 397 cases in African Americans) under an additive genetic model. The results showed that 3 SNPs in whites (rs599839, rs1333049, and rs501120; HRRs were 1.10 (P = 0.044), 1.14 (P < 0.001), and 1.14 (P = 0.030), respectively) and 1 SNP in African Americans (rs7250581; HRR = 1.60, P = 0.05) were significantly associated with incident CHD. This study demonstrates that genetic variants revealed in a case-control genome-wide association study enriched for early disease onset may play a role in the genetic etiology of CHD in the general population.},

abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS Accumulating evidence suggests an association between coronary heart disease and risk for cognitive impairment or dementia, but no study has systematically reviewed this association. Therefore, we summarized the available evidence on the association between coronary heart disease and risk for cognitive impairment or dementia. METHODS Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL were searched for all publications until 8th January 2016. Articles were included if they fulfilled the inclusion criteria: (1) myocardial infarction, angina pectoris or coronary heart disease (combination of both) as predictor variable; (2) cognition, cognitive impairment or dementia as outcome; (3) population-based study; (4) prospective (≥1 year follow-up), cross-sectional or case-control study design; (5) ≥100 participants; and (6) aged ≥45 years. Reference lists of publications and secondary literature were hand-searched for possible missing articles. Two reviewers independently screened all abstracts and extracted information from potential relevant full-text articles using a standardized data collection form. Study quality was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We pooled estimates from the most fully adjusted model using random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS We identified 6,132 abstracts, of which 24 studies were included. A meta-analysis of 10 prospective cohort studies showed that coronary heart disease was associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment or dementia (OR = 1.45, 95%CI = 1.21-1.74, p<0.001). Between-study heterogeneity was low (I2 = 25.7%, 95%CI = 0-64, p = 0.207). Similar significant associations were found in separate meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies for the individual predictors (myocardial infarction, angina pectoris). In contrast, meta-analyses of cross-sectional and case-control studies were inconclusive. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION This meta-analysis suggests that coronary heart disease is prospectively associated with increased odds of developing cognitive impairment or dementia. Given the projected worldwide increase in the number of people affected by coronary heart disease and dementia, insight into causal mechanisms or common pathways underlying the heart-brain connection is needed.},

First, design concepts of a WBS are presented, with emphasis on the ring sensor developed by the author's group at MIT. The ring sensor is an ambulatory, telemetric, continuous health-monitoring device. This WBS combines miniaturized data acquisition features with advanced photoplethysmographic (PPG) techniques to acquire data related to the patient's cardiovascular state using a method that is far superior to existing fingertip PPG sensors. In particular, the ring sensor is capable of reliably monitoring a patient's heart rate, oxygen saturation, and heart rate variability. Technical issues, including motion artifact, interference with blood circulation, and battery power issues, are addressed, and effective engineering solutions to alleviate these problems are presented. Second, based on the ring sensor technology the clinical potentials of WBS monitoring are addressed.},

abstract = {The influence of acute psychological stress on cardiovascular disease is an emerging public health concern. Identification of brain mechanisms underlying this may aid in the discovery of possible treatments. Acute psychological stress may induce arteri- olar vasoconstriction and reduce blood flow to vital organs. We hypothesized that functional changes in brain regions involved with memory and autonomic/emotional regulation are implicated in the vasoconstrictive stress response, including the me- dial prefrontal cortex (anterior cingulate), insula, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Subjects with a history of coronary artery disease (N = 59) underwent measurement of microvascular vasomotor tone with the EndoPAT device and O–15 positron emis- sion tomography (PET) imaging of the brain during exposure to mental stress and control conditions. The peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) ratio was calculated as the mean peripheral vasomotor tone during stress divided by the mean tone during rest. Whole brain contrasts were performed between groups above and below the median PAT ratio, and significant contrasts were defined with cutoff p < 0.005. Stress‐induced peripheral vasoconstriction (below median PAT ratio) was associated with increased stress activation in insula and parietal cortex, and decreased activation in the medial prefrontal cortex with stress tasks compared to control tasks. These findings demonstrate that stress‐induced vasoreactivity is associated with changes in brain responses to stress in areas involved in emotion and autonomic regulation. These findings have important implications on possible treatments for mental stress‐ induced vascular toxicity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Low heart rate variability (HRV), a marker of cardiac autonomic dysfunction, has been associated with major risk factors of cognitive impairment. Yet, the direct association of HRV with cognitive function remains relatively unexplored, particularly in midlife. METHODS In 2005, 2 measures of short-term HRV, the SD of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN) and the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), were calculated for participants of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study, and then categorized into quartiles. Five years later, 3 cognitive tests were administered for verbal memory ("Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test", RAVLT, range 0-15), processing speed ("Digit Symbol Substitution Test", DSST, range 0-133), and executive function ("Stroop interference"). RESULTS Two thousand one hundred and eighteen participants (57.7% female, 42.2% Black) with a mean baseline age of 45.3 years were included in this analysis. In demographic-adjusted models, compared to participants with quartile 1 SDNN (lowest quartile), participants in the upper quartiles of SDNN scored better on the DSST (quartile 4: $\beta$ = 1.83 points better, P = 0.03; and quartile 3: $\beta$ = 1.95 points better, P = 0.03) and on the stroop (quartile 3: $\beta$ = 1.19 points better, P < 0.05; and quartile2: $\beta$ = 1.44 points better, P = 0.02). After adjusting for behavioral and cardiovascular risk factors, higher quartile SDNN remained significantly associated with better stroop score (quartile 3: $\beta$ = 1.21 points better, P = 0.04; and quartile 2: $\beta$ = 1.72 points better, P < 0.01) but not with DSST. There was no association between quartile of RMSSD and cognitive function, from fully adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that higher quartile SDDN is associated with better executive function in midlife, above, and beyond cardiovascular risk factors.},

abstract = {The autonomic system and sympathetic activation appears integral in the pathogenesis of acute mountain sickness (AMS) at high altitude (HA), yet a link between heart rate variability (HRV) and AMS has not been convincingly shown. In this study we investigated the utility of the smartphone-derived HRV score to predict and diagnose AMS at HA. Twenty-one healthy adults were investigated at baseline at 1400 m and over 10 days during a trek to 5140 m. HRV was recorded using the ithlete HRV device. Acute mountain sickness occurred in 11 subjects (52.4%) at >2650 m. HRV inversely correlated with AMS Scores (r = −0.26; 95% CI, −0.38 to −0.13: P < 0.001). HRV significantly fell at 3700, 4100, and 5140 m versus low altitude. HRV scores were lower in those with both mild (69.7 ± 14.0) and severe AMS (67.1 ± 13.1) versus those without AMS (77.5 ± 13.1; effect size n2 = 0.043: P = 0.007). The HRV score was weakly predictive of severe AMS (AUC 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58-0.89: P = 0.006). The change (delta) in the HRV Score (compared with baseline at 1400 m) was a moderate diagnostic marker of severe AMS (AUC 0.80; 95% CI, 0.70-0.90; P = 0.0004). A fall in the HRV score of >5 had a sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 60% to identify severe AMS (likelihood ratio 1.9). Baseline HRV at 1400 m was not predictive of either AMS at higher altitudes. The ithlete HRV score can be used to help in the identification of severe AMS; however, a baseline score is not predictive of future AMS development at HA.},

abstract = {The intravenous infusion of adenosine provokes anginalike chest pain. To establish its origin, an intracoronary infusion of increasing adenosine concentrations was given in 22 patients with stable angina pectoris. During adenosine infusion, 20 patients had chest pain without electrocardiographic signs of ischemia. They all reported that the chest pain was similar to their usual anginal pain. In 10 of the 22 patients adenosine was also infused into the right atrium, but it never produced symptoms at the doses that had provoked chest pain during intracoronary infusion. In seven other patients, the intracoronary adenosine infusion was repeated after intravenous administration of aminophylline, an antagonist of adenosine P1-receptors. Aminophylline decreased the severity of adenosine-induced chest pain (assessed with a visual analog scale) from 42 +/- 22 to 23 +/- 17 mm (p less than 0.002). In the remaining five of the 22 patients, monitoring of blood oxygen saturation in the coronary sinus during intracoronary adenosine administration showed that maximum coronary vasodilation was achieved at doses lower than those responsible for chest pain. A single-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of the effect of aminophylline on exercise-induced chest pain was also performed in 20 other patients with stable angina. Aminophylline, compared with placebo, decreased the severity of chest pain at peak exercise from 67 +/- 21 to 51 +/- 23 mm (p less than 0.02), despite the achievement of a similar degree of ST-segment depression. Finally, the effect of intravenous adenosine was compared in 10 patients with predominantly painful myocardial ischemia and in 10 patients with predominantly silent ischemia.},

PARTICIPANTS Ninety-four patients meeting MCI clinical criteria supported by psychometric measures, 93 patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score > or =17), and 90 healthy elderly controls (NC). MEASUREMENTS The MoCA and MMSE were administered to all participants, and sensitivity and specificity of both measures were assessed for detection of MCI and mild AD. RESULTS Using a cutoff score 26, the MMSE had a sensitivity of 18% to detect MCI, whereas the MoCA detected 90% of MCI subjects. In the mild AD group, the MMSE had a sensitivity of 78%, whereas the MoCA detected 100%. Specificity was excellent for both MMSE and MoCA (100% and 87%, respectively). CONCLUSION MCI as an entity is evolving and somewhat controversial. The MoCA is a brief cognitive screening tool with high sensitivity and specificity for detecting MCI as currently conceptualized in patients performing in the normal range on the MMSE.},

abstract = {The functional organization of the cardiovascular system shows clear circadian rhythmicity. These and other circadian rhythms at all levels of organization are orchestrated by a central biological clock, the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus. Preservation of the normal circadian time structure from the level of the cardiomyocyte to the organ system appears to be essential for cardiovascular health and cardiovascular disease prevention. Myocardial ischemia, acute myocardial infarct, and sudden cardiac death are much greater in incidence than expected in the morning. Moreover, supraventricular and ventricular cardiac arrhythmias of various types show specific day-night patterns, with atrial arrhythmias - premature beats, tachycardias, atrial fibrillation, and flutter - generally being of higher frequency during the day than night - and ventricular fibrillation and ventricular premature beats more common, respectively, in the morning and during the daytime activity than sleep span. Furthermore, different circadian patterns of blood pressure are found in arterial hypertension, in relation to different cardiovascular morbidity and mortality risk. Such temporal patterns result from circadian periodicity in pathophysiological mechanisms that give rise to predictable-in-time differences in susceptibility-resistance to cyclic environmental stressors that trigger these clinical events. Circadian rhythms also may affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of cardiovascular and other medications. Knowledge of 24-h patterns in the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality plus circadian rhythm-dependencies of underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms suggests the requirement for preventive and therapeutic interventions is not the same throughout the day and night, and should be tailored accordingly to improve outcomes. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Sudden death is frequently of cardiac origin, and its most common electrophysiologic mechanism is ventricular fibrillation. The concept that sudden death in human beings is due to ventricular fibrillation was first proposed by MacWilliam exactly 100 years ago, well before the electrocardiogram was invented. To conduct his experimental work, MacWilliam devised methods that laid the foundations for modern cardiac research and that provided the first comprehensive approach to successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation. He recognized the role of the autonomic nervous system in modulating both the mechanical and the electrical properties of the heart, and was the first to suggest that this effect had a role in the genesis of sudden death. On the centennial of his theory of sudden death, MacWilliam's concepts are reviewed in the context of the effect of Darwinian influence on British physiology. It is suggested that his theorem was based on both sound experimental data and comparative physiology, drawing on the new evolutionary principle of similar structure and function in the hearts of various species. MacWilliam's basic physiologic concepts have survived intact for a century, greatly influencing more than three generations of research and practice in clinical cardiology. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {In this work, a univariate and multivariate statistical analysis of indexes derived from heart rate variability (HRV) was conducted to stratify patients with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) in cardiac risk groups. Indexes conditional entropy, refined multiscale entropy (RMSE), detrended fluctuation analysis, time and frequency analysis, were applied to the RR interval series (beat-to-beat series), for single and multiscale complexity analysis of the HRV in IDC patients. Also, clinical parameters were considered. Two different end-points after a follow-up of three years were considered: (i) analysis A, with 151 survivor patients as a low risk group and 13 patients that suffered sudden cardiac death as a high risk group; (ii) analysis B, with 192 survivor patients as a low risk group and 30 patients that suffered cardiac mortality as a high risk group. A univariate and multivariate linear discriminant analysis was used as a statistical technique for classifying patients in risk groups. Sensitivity (Sen) and specificity (Spe) were calculated as diagnostic criteria in order to evaluate the performance of the indexes and their linear combinations. Sen and Spe values of 80.0% and 72.9%, respectively, were obtained during daytime by combining one clinical parameter and one index from RMSE, and during nighttime Sen = 80% and Spe = 73.4% were attained by combining one clinical factor and two indexes from RMSE. In particular, relatively long time scales were more relevant for classifying patients into risk groups during nighttime, while during daytime shorter scales performed better. The results suggest that the left atrial size, indexed to body surface and RMSE indexes are those that allow enhanced classification of ischemic patients in their respective risk groups, confirming that a single measurement is not enough to fully characterize ischemic risk patients and the clinical relevance of HRV complexity measures.},

abstract = {Objectives The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of evaluation for appropriate use of radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in multiple clinical sites and to determine use patterns as well as identify areas of apparent inappropriate use.Background Although cardiac imaging is highly valued for decision-making, the growth and expense related to these procedures has raised questions regarding overuse. The publication of appropriate use criteria (AUC), including those for MPI, were designed to provide guidance in the rational use of testing. However, limited data regarding the implementation and evaluation of AUC are available.Methods Six diverse clinical sites enrolled consecutive patients undergoing MPI, collecting point-of-service data entered into an online form. An automated algorithm assigned a specific indication from the AUC that was classified as appropriate, uncertain, or inappropriate. Site-specific feedback was later provided to each practice on ordering patterns.Results Of the 6,351 patients enrolled, 93% were successfully assigned an appropriateness level. Inappropriate use of MPI was found in 14.4% of patients, with a range of 4% to 22% among practices. Women and younger patients were more likely to undergo inappropriate MPI. Asymptomatic, low-risk patients accounted for 44.5% of inappropriate testing. Elimination of the 5 most common inappropriate use indications would reduce overall imaging volume by 13.2%. Inappropriate use by physicians from within the practice performing imaging was not greater than physicians outside of the practice. Educational feedback might have resulted in reduced inappropriate test ordering in 1 site.Conclusions The tracking of appropriate use is feasible in clinical practice, with an automated system that can readily identify practice patterns and targets for educational and quality improvement initiatives. This approach might provide an alternative to utilization management.},

abstract = {Background The Secondary Prevention in Uppsala Primary Healthcare Project (SUPRIM) was a randomized controlled trial of a group-based cognitive behavioural therapy stress management programme for patients with coronary heart disease. The project was successful in reducing the risk of fatal or non-fatal first recurrent cardiovascular events. The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of cognitive behavioural therapy on self-rated stress, somatic anxiety, vital exhaustion and depression and to study the associations of these factors with the reduction in cardiovascular events. Methods A total of 362 patients were randomly assigned to intervention or usual care groups. The psychological outcomes were assessed five times during 24 months and analysed using linear mixed models. The mediating roles of the outcomes were analysed using joint modelling of the longitudinal and time to event data. Results The intervention had a positive effect on somatic anxiety ( p < 0.05), reflecting a beneficial development over time compared with the controls. Stress, vital exhaustion and depression did not differ between the groups over time. Mediator analysis suggested that somatic anxiety may have mediated the effect of treatment on cardiovascular events. Conclusions The intervention had a small positive effect on somatic anxiety, but did not affect stress, vital exhaustion or depression in patients with coronary heart disease. Somatic anxiety was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and might act as a partial mediator in the treatment effect on cardiovascular events. However, the mechanisms between the intervention and the protective cardiovascular outcome remain to be identified.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Stimulation of left ventricular (LV) receptors with sympathetic afferents generally results in reflex sympathoexcitatory responses. Stimulation of LV receptors with vagal afferents results in reflex sympathoinhibitory responses. Vagal afferents are known to be preferentially distributed to the inferoposterior (IP) wall of the LV. We tested the hypothesis that there is also a preferential distribution of LV sympathetic afferents. METHODS AND RESULTS We measured reflex responses to stimulation of sympathetic afferents located in the anterior and IP LV: We used myocardial ischemia and chemical stimuli to increase the activity of the sensory endings in 15 chloralose-anesthetized, mechanically ventilated dogs with sinoaortic denervation and vagotomy. Reflex responses were assessed by direct recordings of efferent renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA). In nine dogs, maximal RSNA changes elicited by transmural anterior myocardial ischemia (22.6 +/- 3.9% increase from baseline nerve traffic) were not significantly different from maximal RSNA changes observed during transmural IP ischemia (27.1 +/- 4.4%). Similar changes in mean arterial and left atrial pressures were noted during transmural anterior and IP ischemia. In eight dogs, maximal changes of RSNA elicited by epicardial or intracoronary bradykinin to the anterior LV were not significantly different from those observed during bradykinin to the IP LV (anterior epicardial bradykinin, 76.7 +/- 11.7%; IP epicardial bradykinin, 72.2 +/- 10.0%; anterior intracoronary bradykinin, 84.6 +/- 21.0%; IP intracoronary bradykinin, 88.8 +/- 17.3%). CONCLUSIONS We conclude that cardiac receptors with sympathetic afferents are distributed equally to the IP and anterior regions of the LV.},

abstract = {Background: Mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia is a frequent phenomenon in patients with coronary artery disease. Women with coronary artery disease tend to have more mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia and more chest pain/anginal symptoms than men, but whether the association between mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia and angina burden differs in women and men is unknown. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study with experimental manipulation of 950 individuals with stable coronary artery disease. Chest pain/angina frequency in the previous 4 weeks was assessed with the Seattle Angina Questionnaire's angina-frequency subscale. Mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia was assessed with myocardial perfusion imaging during mental stress (standardized public speaking task). Presence of mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia was based on expert readers and established criteria. A conventional (exercise or pharmacologic) stress test was used as a control condition. Results: Overall, 338 individuals (37%) reported angina; 112 (12%) developed mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia, and 256 (29%) developed conventional stress ischemia. Women who reported angina had almost double the probability to develop mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia (19% vs 10%, adjusted prevalence rate ratio, 1.90; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-3.46), whereas there was no such difference in men (11% vs 11%, adjusted prevalence rate ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval, 0.66-1.82). No association was found between angina symptoms and conventional stress ischemia for women or men. Results for ischemia as a continuous variable were similar. Conclusions: In women, but not in men, anginal symptoms may be a marker of vulnerability toward ischemia induced by psychologic stress. These results highlight the psychosocial origins of angina in women and may have important implications for the management and prognosis of women with angina.},

abstract = {Recent investigations indicate a site of cardiac representation within the left insular cortex of the rat. Moreover, the results of lesion studies suggest left-sided insular dominance for sympathetic cardiovascular effects. It is unclear whether similar representation exists within the human insular cortex. Five epileptic patients underwent intraoperative insular stimulation prior to temporal lobectomy for seizure control. On stimulation of the left insular cortex, bradycardia and depressor responses were more frequently produced than tachycardia and pressor effects (p less than 0.005). The converse applied for the right insular cortex. We believe this to be the first demonstration of cardiovascular changes elicitable during insular stimulation in humans, and of lateralization of such responses for a cortical site. In humans, unlike the rat, there appears to be right-sided dominance for sympathetic effects. These findings may be of relevance in predicting the autonomic effects of stroke in humans and in the explanation of sudden unexpected epileptic death.},

@article{Fukuda2015,
abstract = {Afferent and efferent cardiac neurotransmission via the cardiac nerves intricately modulates nearly all physiological functions of the heart (chronotropy, dromotropy, lusitropy, and inotropy). Afferent information from the heart is transmitted to higher levels of the nervous system for processing (intrinsic cardiac nervous system, extracardiac-intrathoracic ganglia, spinal cord, brain stem, and higher centers), which ultimately results in efferent cardiomotor neural impulses (via the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves). This system forms interacting feedback loops that provide physiological stability for maintaining normal rhythm and life-sustaining circulation. This system also ensures that there is fine-tuned regulation of sympathetic–parasympathetic balance in the heart under normal and stressed states in the short (beat to beat), intermediate (minutes to hours), and long term (days to years). This important neurovisceral/autonomic nervous system also plays a major role in the pathophysiology and progression of heart disease, including heart failure and arrhythmias leading to sudden cardiac death. Transdifferentiation of neurons in heart failure, functional denervation, cardiac and extracardiac neural remodeling has also been identified and characterized during the progression of disease. Recent advances in understanding the cellular and molecular processes governing innervation and the functional control of the myocardium in health and disease provide a rational mechanistic basis for the development of neuraxial therapies for preventing sudden cardiac death and other arrhythmias. Advances in cellular, molecular, and bioengineering realms have underscored the emergence of this area as an important avenue of scientific inquiry and therapeutic intervention.},

Depression is associated with autonomic nervous system dysfunction, which may at least partially explain this increased risk. Low heart rate variability (HRV), which reflects excessive sympathetic and/or inadequate parasympathetic modulation of heart rate, is a strong predictor of mortality in patients with CHD. Most studies-both in patients with stable CHD and in patients with a recent acute coronary event-have found HRV to be lower in depressed patients than in their nondepressed counterparts. This manuscript provides an overview of this literature and concludes that HRV may account for a substantial part of the risk associated with depression in CHD.},

abstract = {The renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in the regulation of arterial blood pressure and in the development of some forms of clinical and experimental hypertension. It is an important blood pressure control system in its own right but also interacts extensively with other blood pressure control systems, including the sympathetic nervous system and the baroreceptor reflexes. Angiotensin (ANG) II exerts several actions on the sympathetic nervous system. These include a central action to increase sympathetic outflow, stimulatory effects on sympathetic ganglia and the adrenal medulla, and actions at sympathetic nerve endings that serve to facilitate sympathetic neurotransmission. ANG II also interacts with baroreceptor reflexes. For example, it acts centrally to modulate the baroreflex control of heart rate, and this accounts for its ability to increase blood pressure without causing a reflex bradycardia. The physiological significance of these actions of ANG II is not fully understood. Most evidence indicates that the actions of ANG to enhance sympathetic activity do not contribute significantly to the pressor response to exogenous ANG II. On the other hand, there is considerable evidence that the actions of endogenous ANG II on the sympathetic nervous system enhance the cardiovascular responses elicited by activation of the sympathetic nervous system.},

abstract = {Increased platelet aggregation in the morning and upon assuming an upright posture may account at least in part for the observed circadian variation in onset of acute myocardial infarction. The Physicians' Health Study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of alternate-day aspirin intake (325 mg) among 22,071 US male physicians, afforded the opportunity to assess this circadian pattern and examine whether it is altered by aspirin therapy. During a 5-year period of follow-up, 342 cases of nonfatal myocardial infarction were confirmed, of which the time of onset was available in 211 (62%). The placebo group showed a bimodal circadian variation in onset of myocardial infarction with a primary peak between 4:00 AM and 10:00 AM (p less than 0.001). In the aspirin group, however, this circadian variation was minimal (p = 0.16), due primarily to a marked reduction in the morning peak of infarction. Specifically, aspirin was associated with a 59.3% reduction in the incidence of infarction during the morning waking hours, compared with a 34.1% reduction for the remaining hours of the day. The greater reduction was observed during the 3-hour interval immediately after awakening, a period with a risk of infarction twice that of any other comparable time interval (p less than 0.001). Aspirin intake was associated with a mean reduction in the incidence of infarction of 44.8% over the entire 24-hour cycle. These data support the hypothesis that increased platelet aggregability in the morning and upon arising contributes to the occurrence of myocardial infarction and that aspirin reduces the risk of infarction by inhibiting platelet aggregation during these critical periods.},

For example, women double the rates of stress-related mental disorders such as depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than men, and have higher rates of exposure to adversity early in life. This profile may increase women's long-term risk of cardiometabolic conditions linked to stress, especially coronary heart disease (CHD). In addition to having a higher prevalence of psychosocial stressors, women may be more vulnerable to the adverse effects of these stressors on CHD, perhaps through altered neurobiological physiology. Emerging data suggest that young women are disproportionally susceptible to the adverse effects of stress on the risk of cardiovascular disease, both in terms of initiating the disease as well as worsening the prognosis in women who have already exhibited symptoms of the disease. Women's potential vulnerability to psychosocial stress could also help explain their higher propensity toward abnormal coronary vasomotion and microvascular disease compared with men.},

abstract = {The movement of ions across specific channels embedded on the membrane of individual cardiomyocytes is crucial for the generation and propagation of the cardiac electric impulse. Emerging evidence over the past 20 years strongly suggests that the normal electric function of the heart is the result of dynamic interactions of membrane ion channels working in an orchestrated fashion as part of complex molecular networks. Such networks work together with exquisite temporal precision to generate each action potential and contraction. Macromolecular complexes play crucial roles in transcription, translation, oligomerization, trafficking, membrane retention, glycosylation, post-translational modification, turnover, function, and degradation of all cardiac ion channels known to date. In addition, the accurate timing of each cardiac beat and contraction demands, a comparable precision on the assembly and organizations of sodium, calcium, and potassium channel complexes within specific subcellular microdomains, where physical proximity allows for prompt and efficient interaction. This review article, part of the Compendium on Sudden Cardiac Death, discusses the major issues related to the role of ion channel macromolecular assemblies in normal cardiac electric function and the mechanisms of arrhythmias leading to sudden cardiac death. It provides an idea of how these issues are being addressed in the laboratory and in the clinic, which important questions remain unanswered, and what future research will be needed to improve knowledge and advance therapy.},

abstract = {Study objectives: Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery is a common and successful procedure for revascularisation. However, the experience can induce emotional reactions prior to and following surgery. This study aimed to document changes in blood pressure (BP) reactivity and heart rate variability (HRV) following CABG surgery, and to determine the impact of mood state, particularly anxiety and depression upon cardiovascular functioning. Method: Twenty-two patients preparing to receive elective, first time CABG surgery were recruited from The Cardiothoracic Centre, Liverpool, UK and psychologically assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD), Global Mood Scale (GMS) and the Dispositional Resilience Scale (DRI). BP and heart rate responses were also measured during four conditions: baseline response; laboratory session; ambulatory monitoring; and self-initialised recordings during the ambulatory period. In addition, HRV was measured for 12 h in conjunction with the ambulatory monitoring period. All measures were assessed 1 week prior to surgery and 2 months following surgery. Results: A significant decrease in negative mood and an increase in positive mood were reported following surgery. Forty percent of patients were clinically anxious and depressed prior to surgery although this was reduced to 27% after surgery. Depression was the strongest independent predictor of pre-operative BP and HRV whilst anxiety was most significantly related to follow-up BP reactivity. DBP was most strongly predicted by mood state. Conclusions: These results suggest that patients with higher levels of anxiety and depression are at risk of reduced HRV and increased BP reactivity in response to mental stressors. The study also strongly suggests that current patient services should be expanded to acknowledge the role of psychological factors within clinical prognosis after CABG surgery. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the impact of power mobility devices (PMDs) varies as a function of stage of usage and to explore key factors associated with greater life-space mobility for middle-aged and older adults.\n\nDESIGN: Multicohort study with respondents grouped as a function of stage of PMD usage (reference group with mobility impairments, n=42; initial users, 1-6mo, n=35; long-term users, 12-18mo, n=39). Cohorts were compared with respect to life-space mobility in a continuum of environments ranging from home to outside town, using analysis of variance and chi-square tests. Baseline personal, assistive device, intervention, and environmental factors associated with life-space mobility were explored with age-adjusted linear regression models.\n\nSETTING: Four Canadian rehabilitation centers.\n\nPARTICIPANTS: Random sample of middle-aged and older adults (N=116; 50-89y) living in the community or residential care.\n\nINTERVENTION: Procurement of a powered wheelchair or scooter.\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Life-Space Assessment composite score.\n\nRESULTS: Cohort comparisons showed higher frequency of outings for PMD users in the neighborhood (P<.001) and around home (P<.05) and significantly greater Life-Space Assessment composite scores for initial and long-term users than for the reference group (P<.05). Factors such as sex, the nature of activities, and device type explained variances in Life-Space Assessment composite score ranging from 15.9% to 18.0% (P<.006).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Life-space mobility increases after PMD use and remains stable across the stages of initial and long-term use. To appreciate the impact of PMDs, clinicians should consider the environment and a combination of personal and device factors that are associated with the range of life-space mobility in the first 18 months after procurement.},

@article{Herring2012,
abstract = {The autonomic phenotype of congestive cardiac failure is characterised by high sympathetic drive and impaired vagal tone, which are independent predictors of mortality. We hypothesize that impaired bradycardia to peripheral vagal stimulation following high-level sympathetic drive is due to sympatho-vagal crosstalk by the adrenergic co-transmitters galanin and neuropeptide-Y (NPY). Moreover we hypothesize that galanin acts similarly to NPY by reducing vagal acetylcholine release via a receptor mediated, protein kinase-dependent pathway. Prolonged right stellate ganglion stimulation (10Hz, 2min, in the presence of 10$\mu$M metoprolol) in an isolated guinea pig atrial preparation with dual autonomic innervation leads to a significant (p<0.05) reduction in the magnitude of vagal bradycardia (5Hz) maintained over the subsequent 20min (n=6). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the presence of galanin in a small number of tyrosine hydroxylase positive neurons from freshly dissected stellate ganglion tissue sections. Following 3days of tissue culture however, most stellate neurons expressed galanin. Stellate stimulation caused the release of low levels of galanin and significantly higher levels of NPY into the surrounding perfusate (n=6, using ELISA). The reduction in vagal bradycardia post sympathetic stimulation was partially reversed by the galanin receptor antagonist M40 after 10min (1$\mu$M, n=5), and completely reversed with the NPY Y 2 receptor antagonist BIIE 0246 at all time points (1$\mu$M, n=6). Exogenous galanin (n=6, 50-500nM) also reduced the heart rate response to vagal stimulation but had no effect on the response to carbamylcholine that produced similar degrees of bradycardia (n=6). Galanin (500nM) also significantly attenuated the release of 3H-acetylcholine from isolated atria during field stimulation (5Hz, n=5). The effect of galanin on vagal bradycardia could be abolished by the galanin receptor antagonist M40 (n=5). Importantly the GalR 1 receptor was immunofluorescently co-localised with choline acetyl-transferase containing neurons at the sinoatrial node. The protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin (100nM, n=6) abolished the effect of galanin on vagal bradycardia whilst the protein kinase A inhibitor H89 (500nM, n=6) had no effect. These results demonstrate that prolonged sympathetic activation releases the slowly diffusing adrenergic co-transmitter galanin in addition to NPY, and that this contributes to the attenuation in vagal bradycardia via a reduction in acetylcholine release. This effect is mediated by GalR 1 receptors on vagal neurons coupled to protein kinase C dependent signalling pathways. The role of galanin may become more important following an acute injury response where galanin expression is increased. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The rich autonomic innervation of the heart plays an important role in modifying cardiovascular function. Recently developed in vivo scintigraphic imaging techniques allow for visualization of the autonomic innervation of the heart. Studies using the modalities have shown heterogeneity of sympathetic innervation in various kinds of pathological conditions as well as normal human heart. The inferioposterior region shows typically less sympathetic innervation than the anterior region. In addition, neuropathic processes appear to commence in inferior-apical regions extending towards the base of the heart. Arrhythmogeneity has been related to the heterogeneous innervation of the heart and heterogeneous uptake of radiolabeled catecholamine analogues, such as I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine, can be found in patients with arrhythmia. In dilated cardiomyopathy, reduced uptake indicates a poor prognosis which allows risk stratification for patients with heart failure. Heterogeneity of the reinnervation process following heart transplantation has also been investigated. Evidence was found of reinnervation primarily in the basal anterioseptal region and to a lesser degree in the inferioposterior and apical regions. Tracer approaches are uniquely suited to identify regionally altered innervation and provide tools for linking information on cardiac autonomic innervation with other clinical aspects.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis has been shown to be a predictor of sudden cardiac death and all-cause mortality in patients with cardiac disease. OBJECTIVES: To examine whether newer HRV analysis algorithms, as used by the HeartTrends device, are superior to exercise stress testing (EST) for the detection of myocardial ischemia in patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: We present pilot data of the first 100 subjects enrolled in a clinical trial designed to evaluate the yield of short-term (1 hour) HRV testing for the detection of myocardial ischemia. The study population comprised subjects without known CAD referred to a tertiary medical center for EST with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). All patients underwent a 1 hour electrocardiographic acquisition for HRV analysis with a HeartTrends device prior to ESTwith MPI. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively) were calculated for EST and HRV analysis, using MPI as the gold standard for the non-invasive detection of myocardial ischemia. RESULTS: In this cohort 15% had a pathologic MPI result. HRV analysis showed superior sensitivity (85%), PPV (50%) and NPV (97%) as compared to standard EST (53%, 42%, 90%, respectively), while the specificity of the two tests was similar (86% and 85%, respectively). The close agreement between HRV and MPI was even more pronounced among patients > 65 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot data suggest that the diagnostic yield of the novel HeartTrends HRV algorithm is superior to conventional EST for the non-invasive detection of myocardial ischemia.},

abstract = {To determine the time course of afferent sympathetic and vagal denervation after coronary occlusion and that of neural recovery after reperfusion, we measured the vasopressor responses to bradykinin and the vasodepressor responses to nicotine applied in a felt pad to the left ventricular epicardium of open-chest dogs. Shortly after latex injection of a diagonal branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), the vasopressor response to bradykinin applied to the transmural ischemic area (n = 7) or apically to it (n = 6) was interrupted or attenuated. In contrast, nontransmural ischemia produced by ligation of the diagonal branch did not attenuate the response to bradykinin applied to the ischemic region (n = 6) or apically to it (n = 7). Transmural ischemia produced by occlusion of a diagonal branch of the LAD and a lateral marginal branch of the left circumflex coronary artery (n = 8) or by intraluminal balloon occlusion of the LAD (n = 7) decreased the vasopressor response to bradykinin applied within or apically to the ischemic area in < 13 min. The vasopressor response to bradykinin became attenuated when the myocardial blood flow in the epicardial test site decreased to $\sim$ 40% or less of the control value. Nontransmural ischemia produced by occlusion of a diagonal branch (n = 7) attenuated the vasodepressor response to nicotine applied to the nonischemic area apically to the occlusion in < 13 min. A 15-min coronary occlusion followed by reperfusion produced reversible attenuation of afferent neural responses. We conclude that ischemia interrupts afferent sympathetic and vagal cardiac reflex responses to bradykinin and nicotine and that these alterations are reversible after reperfusion.},

abstract = {Autonomic dysfunction is implicated in prehypertension, and previous studies have suggested that therapies that improve modulation of sympathovagal balance, such as biofeedback and slow abdominal breathing, are effective in patients with prehypertension at rest. However, considering that psychophysiological stressors may be associated with greater cardiovascular risk in prehypertensives, it is important to investigate whether heart rate variability biofeedback (HRV-BF) results in equivalent effects on autonomic cardiovascular responses control during stressful conditions in prehypertensives. A total of 32 college students with prehypertension were enrolled and randomly assigned to HRV-BF (n=12), slow abdominal breathing (SAB, n=10) or no treatment (control, n=10) groups. Then, a training experiment consisting of 15 sessions was employed to compare the effect of each intervention on the following cardiovascular response indicators before and after intervention: heart rate (HR); heart rate variability (HRV) components; blood volume pulse amplitude (BVPamp); galvanic skin response; respiration rate (RSP); and blood pressure. In addition, the cold pressor test and the mental arithmetic challenge test were also performed over two successive days before and after the invention as well as after 3 months of follow-up. A significant decrease in HR and RSP and a significant increase in BVPamp were observed after the HRV-BF intervention (P<0.001). For the HRV analysis, HRV-BF significantly reduced the ratio of low-frequency power to high-frequency power (the LF/HF ratio, P<0.001) and increased the normalized high-frequency power (HFnm) (P<0.001) during the stress tests, and an added benefit over SAB by improving HRV was also observed. In the 3-month follow-up study, similar effects on RSP, BVPamp, LF/HF and HFnm were observed in the HRV-BF group compared with the SAB group. HRV-BF training contributes to the beneficial effect of reducing the stress-related cardiovascular response in prehypertensives by improving autonomic sympathovagal modulation.Journal of Human Hypertension advance online publication, 30 April 2015; doi:10.1038/jhh.2015.27.},

abstract = {Selective adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists have been used to analyse the effects of stimulation of individual types of adrenoceptor in various parts of the rabbit heart. The selective alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists used were St 587 and BHT 933 respectively, and the antagonists were prazosin (alpha 1) and WY 25309 (alpha 2). The selective beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonists were atenolol and ICI 118551, respectively. Pirbuterol was a highly selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist. The non-selective agonists noradrenaline, adrenaline and isoprenaline were also employed with various combinations of antagonists. Phenylephrine was found to stimulate beta- as well as alpha-adrenoceptors. Rimiterol was a beta-adrenoceptor agonist, partially selective for beta 2-adrenoceptors. In the sinus node beta 1-, but not beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation increased the fast phase of depolarization (Vmax). Both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation increased the slope of slow diastolic depolarization, accelerated repolarization and increased maximum diastolic potential. After blockade of both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation caused bradycardia, due exclusively to delayed repolarization. alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulation had no effect. In Purkinje cells and papillary muscle both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation accelerated repolarization. Stimulation of alpha 2-adrenoceptors had no effect. Beta 1-, not beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation augmented peak contractions 3-5-fold, and greatly increased rate of development of tension. After beta-blockade alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation moderately increased peak contractions (up to 47%), but increased time-to-peak and duration of contractions. These patterns of adrenoceptor-mediated effects were unchanged in animals pre-treated with sufficient 6-hydroxydopamine to eliminate responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation. The results would be consistent with beta 1-, and beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation increasing inward calcium current, and with stimulation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors delaying its inactivation, rather than increasing its magnitude.},

abstract = {Mental stress-induced ischemia approximately doubles the risk of cardiac events in patients with coronary artery disease, yet the mechanisms underlying changes in coronary blood flow in response to mental stress are poorly characterized. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) regulates basal coronary blood flow in healthy humans and mediates mental stress-induced vasodilation in the forearm. However, its possible role in mental stress-induced increases in coronary blood flow is unknown. We studied 11 patients (6 men and 5 women, mean age: 58 ± 14 yr) undergoing elective diagnostic cardiac catheterization and assessed the vasodilator response to mental stress elicited by the Stroop color-word test. Intracoronary substance P (20 pmol/min) and isosorbide dinitrate (1 mg) were used to assess endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilation, respectively. Coronary blood flow was estimated using intracoronary Doppler recordings and quantitative coronary angiography to measure coronary artery diameter. Mental stress increased coronary flow by 34 ± 7.0% over the preceding baseline during saline infusion (P < 0.01), and this was reduced to 26 ± 7.0% in the presence of the selective nNOS inhibitor S-methyl-l-thiocitrulline (0.625 µmol/min, P < 0.001). Mental stress increased coronary artery diameter by 6.9 ± 3.7% (P = 0.02) and 0.5 ± 2.8% (P = 0.51) in the presence of S-methyl-l-thiocitrulline. The response to substance P did not predict the response to mental stress (r(2) = -0.22, P = 0.83). nNOS mediates the human coronary vasodilator response to mental stress, predominantly through actions at the level of coronary resistance vessels.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Acute mental stress induces vasodilation of the coronary microvasculature. Here, we show that this response involves neuronal nitric oxide synthase in the human coronary circulation.Listen to this article's corresponding podcast at http://ajpheart.podbean.com/e/nnos-and-coronary-flow-during-mental-stress/.},

Impaired renal function is also a risk factor for developing HFpEF. A new paradigm for HFpEF, proposing a sequence of events leading to myocardial remodelling and dysfunction in HFpEF, was recently introduced, involving inflammatory, microvascular, and cardiac components. The kidney might play a key role in this systemic process. Renal impairment causes metabolic and systemic derangements in circulating factors, causing an activated systemic inflammatory state and endothelial dysfunction, which may lead to cardiomyocyte stiffening, hypertrophy, and interstitial fibrosis via cross-talk between the endothelium and cardiomyocyte compartments. Here, we review the role of endothelial dysfunction and inflammation to explain the link between renal dysfunction and HFpEF, which allows for identification of new early risk markers, prognostic factors, and unique targets for intervention.},

The use of the canine rapid ventricular pacing model of biventricular failure in the investigation of abnormalities of baroreflexes in heart failure is emphasized. Insights obtained from this model should be extended to human investigations.},

For the mental health monitoring two specific functions (independent component analysis (ICA) and nonlinear chaotic analysis (NCA)) are implemented into CMOS integrated circuits. ICA extracts heart rate variability (HRV) from EEG, and then NCA extracts the largest lyapunov exponent (LLE) as physiological marker to identify mental stress and states. The extracted HRV is only 1.84% different from the HRV obtained by simple ECG measurement system. With the help of EEG signals, the proposed headband mental monitoring system shows 90% confidence level in stress test, which is better than the test results of only HRV.},

In this study, we examine the targeting and trafficking of $\beta$1 and $\beta$2ARs at cardiac sympathetic synapses in vitro. Sympathetic neurons form functional synapses with neonatal cardiac myocytes in culture. The myocyte membrane develops into specialized zones that surround contacting axons and contain accumulations of the scaffold proteins SAP97 and AKAP79/150 but are deficient in caveolin-3. The $\beta$1ARs are enriched within these zones, whereas $\beta$2ARs are excluded from them after stimulation of neuronal activity. The results indicate that specialized signaling domains are organized in cardiac myocytes at sites of contact with sympathetic neurons and that these domains are likely to play a role in the subtype-specific regulation of cardiac function by $\beta$1 and $\beta$2ARs in vivo.},

The study found that CXCL12 and CNNM2 gene affects the risk of coronary heart disease, but the relationship with hypertension is unclear. The aim of this research is to explore the association between CXCL12 and CNNM2 gene and hypertension in Chinese Han population. Methods: Genotypes at 11 CHD-relevant SNPs were determined in 350 Hypertension patients and 483 controls in Chinese Han population using $\chi$2test, genetic model analysis and haplotype analysis. Results: In the allele model, CXCL12 rs1065297 “G” allele, CXCL12 rs4948878 “G” allele and CXCL12 rs10793538 “T” allele were associated with decreased risk of hypertension (rs1065297: OR = 0.53, p = 0.005; rs4948878: OR = 0.51, p = 0.004; rs10793538: OR = 0.58, p = 0.005). CNNM2 rs12413409 “A” allele and CNNM2 rs11191514 “T” allele were also associated with reduced risk of hypertension (rs12413409: OR = 0.71, p = 0.003; rs11191514: OR = 0.70, p = 0.002). Further stratified analysis by sex and age found that CXCL12, CNNM2 gene also influence the risk of hypertension. Model analysis found that CXCL12 rs1093538 TA-TT genotype was associated with decreased risk of hypertension in the dominant model (OR = 0.57, p = 0.0015); Log-additive model revealed that rs1065297 and rs4948878 in CXCL12 gene have a potential association with essential hypertension (rs1065297: OR = 0.54, p = 0.005; rs4948878: OR = 0.52, p = 0.0038). For CNNM2 gene, rs12413409 GA-AA genotype and rs11191514 CT-TT genotype was associated with reduced risk of hypertension in the dominant model (rs12413409: OR = 0.64, p = 0.012; rs11191514: OR = 0.63, p = 0.0082). CXCL12 “GCGCCGT” and CNNM2 “ATAG” haplotype were associated with reduced risk of hypertension with 0.57-fold and 0.75-fold. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests that CXCL12, CNNM2 gene influence the risk of hypertension in Chinese Han population.},

In our neurovisceral integration model we have tried to build on this pioneering work. In the present paper we further elaborate our model. Specifically we review recent neuroanatomical studies that implicate inhibitory GABAergic pathways from the prefrontal cortex to the amygdala and additional inhibitory pathways between the amygdala and the sympathetic and parasympathetic medullary output neurons that modulate heart rate and thus heart rate variability. We propose that the default response to uncertainty is the threat response and may be related to the well known negativity bias. We next review the evidence on the role of vagally mediated heart rate variability (HRV) in the regulation of physiological, affective, and cognitive processes. Low HRV is a risk factor for pathophysiology and psychopathology. Finally we review recent work on the genetics of HRV and suggest that low HRV may be an endophenotype for a broad range of dysfunctions. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

It displays nonlinear characteristics of heart rate variability (HRV) from electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings and gives a global view of the long range of ECG signals. In the telemedicine or computer-aided diagnosis system, it would offer significant auxiliary information for diagnosis if the patterns of the Poincare plots can be automatically classified. Therefore, we developed an automatic classification system to distinguish five geometric patterns of the Poincare plots from four types of cardiac arrhythmias. The statistics features are designed on measurements and an ensemble classifier of three types of neural networks is proposed. Aiming at the difficulty to set a proper threshold for classifying the multiple categories, the threshold selection strategy is analyzed. 24 h ECG monitoring recordings from 674 patients, which have four types of cardiac arrhythmias, are adopted for recognition. For comparison, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers with linear and Gaussian kernels are also applied. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the extracted features and the better performance of the designed classifier. Our study can be applied to diagnose the corresponding sinus rhythm and arrhythmia substrates disease automatically in the telemedicine and computer-aided diagnosis system.},

abstract = {Spectral estimates of heart rate variability (HRV) often involve the use of techniques such as the fast Fourier transform (FFT), which require an evenly sampled time series. HRV is calculated from the variations in the beat-to-beat (RR) interval timing of the cardiac cycle which are inherently irregularly spaced in time. In order to produce an evenly sampled time series prior to FFT-based spectral estimation, linear or cubic spline resampling is usually employed. In this paper, by using a realistic artificial RR interval generator, interpolation and resampling is shown to result in consistent over-estimations of the power spectral density (PSD) compared with the theoretical solution. The Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram, a more appropriate spectral estimation technique for unevenly sampled time series that uses only the original data, is shown to provide a superior PSD estimate. Ectopy removal or replacement is shown to be essential regardless of the spectral estimation technique. Resampling and phantom beat replacement is shown to decrease the accuracy of PSD estimation, even at low levels of ectopy or artefact. A linear relationship between the frequency of ectopy/artefact and the error (mean and variance) of the PSD estimate is demonstrated. Comparisons of PSD estimation techniques performed on real RR interval data during minimally active segments (sleep) demonstrate that the LS periodogram provides a less noisy spectral estimate of HRV.},

abstract = {Endurance exercise training promotes numerous cellular adaptations in both cardiac myocytes and skeletal muscle fibers. For example, exercise training fosters changes in mitochondrial function due to increased mitochondrial protein expression and accelerated mitochondrial turnover. Additionally, endurance exercise training alters the abundance of numerous cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins in both cardiac and skeletal muscle myocytes, resulting in a protective phenotype in the active fibers; this exercise-induced protection of cardiac and skeletal muscle fibers is often referred to as "exercise preconditioning." As few as 3-5 consecutive days of endurance exercise training result in a preconditioned cardiac phenotype that is sheltered against ischemia-reperfusion-induced injury. Similarly, endurance exercise training results in preconditioned skeletal muscle fibers that are resistant to a variety of stresses (e.g., heat stress, exercise-induced oxidative stress, and inactivity-induced atrophy). Many studies have probed the mechanisms responsible for exercise-induced preconditioning of cardiac and skeletal muscle fibers; these studies are important, because they provide an improved understanding of the biochemical mechanisms responsible for exercise-induced preconditioning, which has the potential to lead to innovative pharmacological therapies aimed at minimizing stress-induced injury to cardiac and skeletal muscle. This review summarizes the development of exercise-induced protection of cardiac myocytes and skeletal muscle fibers and highlights the putative mechanisms responsible for exercise-induced protection in the heart and skeletal muscles.},

@article{Lown1979a,
abstract = {With the development of coronary care units in the 1960s, attitudes toward sudden cardiac death (SCD) began to change as physicians learned that cardiac arrest was reversible. The problem of SCD has two aspects an acute, precipitating factor and a chronic predisposition to electrical instability of the myocardium. Resolution of the problem requires identification and protection of the potential victim. Ven-tricular premature complexes (VPCs) have been related to the development of serious arrhythmias and early death, but the mere presence of VPCs does not discriminate risk of subsequent fatality. VPCs should be graded according to frequency, persistence, multiformity, repetitive pattern and degree of prematurity. Provocation of repetitive extrasystoles by R-on-T pacing may indicate the presence of a reduced threshold for ventricular fibrillation (VF). Prophylactic antiarrhythmic therapy may help protect patients resuscitated from VF against recurrent cardiac arrest. Neuropharmacologic factors perhaps affecting central nervous system sympathetic activity can alter cardiac vulnerability and may protect against VF. Findings in dogs indicate that psychologic stress can reduce the cardiac threshold for VF. If psychologic factors predispose to ventricular arrhythmias by increasing the level of sympathetic tone, lessening neural sympathetic activity should reduce the incidence of SCD. SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH (SCD) is one of the major challenges to contemporary cardiology. Its sheer magnitude demands attention, claiming over 400 thousand lives annually, or about 60% of all coronary heart disease fatalities. The problem of sudden death has been recognized since the beginning of recorded history, yet before the 1960s, SCD received scant attention from clinical and research communities. In part this related to the prevailing perception that SCD was the ultimate expression of severe, far-advanced and irreversible coronary athero-sclerosis. Since the SCD was unexpected and struck down the seemingly healthy subject outside the hospital , the physician deemed it an act of fate before which he or she was largely helpless. As is often true in science, new methodologies not only usher in new content, but also mold new attitudes. In the case of SCD it was the burgeoning coronary care units (CCU) of the 1960s that stimulated a new direction. CCU experience largely dispelled the sense of futility, for it became rapidly evident that cardiac arrest was reversible. Patients promptly resuscitated from primary electrical failure consistently recovered and survived for variable and prolonged periods determined by the extent of their underlying heart disease. Because ventricular fibrilla-tion (VF) had its highest incidence at the beginning of a myocardial ischemic episode, it was logical to assume that this same mechanism accounted for out-of-hospital sudden death. The CCU demonstrated that VF can be reversed as well as prevented. These findings have led to the development of two distinct strategies:' 1) to reach the patient promptly and initiate effective cardio-pulmonary resuscitation,2 and 2) to identify the patient at increased risk for SCD and institute a prophylactic program against potentially fatal ven-tricular arrhythmias.3 Community Response to Cardiac Arrest The logic of a well-organized community program permitting immediate response to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is not debatable. The critical factor is the expeditious reaching of the victim by personnel fully tutored in basic life support. This necessarily requires that large sectors of the population be trained and their skill in cardiopulmonary resuscitation be finely honed at all times for the unexpected emergency. In Seattle, where such a program has been in operation for over 6 years, there have been 346 long-term survivors out of 1710 episodes of VF encountered in the community.4 The percentage of immediate resuscitations has improved annually, as has the yield in long-term survivors. A disquieting aspect of the Seat-tle experience is the high incidence of recurrent cardiac arrest. The mortality rate has been 26% at 1 year and 36% at two years. The problem of SCD has two aspects-an acute, precipitating trigger as well as a chronic predisposition to electrical instability of the myocardium. The mere reversal of the cardiac arrest does not obviate the underlying electrophysiologic abnormality. For those successfully resuscitated there can be no assurance that the good fortune of a prompt response by a trained medical team will be repeated. Resolution of the problem of SCD ultimately requires identification and protection of the potential victim. Detecting the Patient at Risk The essential strategy currently followed in identifying the patient at risk and in preventing VF relies on the hypothesis that the ventricular premature complex (VPC) constitutes a risk factor.1 3Two questions, therefore, must be answered: 1) What is the evidence that VPCs indeed indicate predisposition to sudden death? 2) Is there any basis for concluding that control of VPCs will protect against VF? 1593 by guest on May 12, 2016 http://circ.ahajournals.org/ Downloaded from},

abstract = {Associations between autonomic nervous system health and cognitive performance have been described in different populations. Autonomic disturbances are a common phenomenon in patients post stroke. Little is known about the relationship between post stroke disturbances of the autonomic nervous system and the commonly occurring disturbances of cognitive functions revealed by victims of stroke. To assess the association between heart rate variability (HRV) and cognitive performance among patients post ischemic stroke and healthy age-matched controls, 13 patients post first-ever ischemic stroke aged 40–80 years and 15 age-matched healthy controls were evaluated. HRV was monitored during sustained handgrip, while breathing at a rate of six breaths per minute, while performing the serial-3 subtraction task sitting at rest, and while cycling. Patients post stroke had greater error rate in the serial-3 subtraction task, and lower HRV (both at rest and during task performance) relative to healthy controls (at rest 26 ms [10–53] vs. 43 ms [29–88]). The HRV of stroke patients showed less sensitivity to changes in testing conditions, and also failed to show the correlation with cognitive performance exhibited by the healthy subjects. Stroke patients experience autonomic nervous system dysfunction in parallel to their motor and cognitive impairments. Too often only the latter receive appropriate treatment consideration in the rehabilitation setting. The current results, and earlier research, point to the importance of focusing clinical attention to the status of the autonomic nervous system, as amelioration of its functioning is likely to enhance motor and cognitive functioning as well.

abstract = {91284342 Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia/Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond BACKGROUND. Left ventricular sympathetic afferent nerves are located mainly in superficial epicardial layers. Reflex excitatory responses mediated by sympathetic afferent nerves have been observed during myocardial ischemia in cats and humans but not in dogs. Previous canine studies have induced ischemia by occlusion of a coronary artery. Extensive collateral circulation in the canine heart may limit ischemia of epicardial layers during simple coronary occlusion, resulting in little stimulation of sympathetic afferent nerves and minimal reflex excitatory responses. METHODS AND RESULTS. In anesthetized dogs with sinoaortic and vagal deafferentation, we determined whether reflex sympathoexcitatory responses mediated by sympathetic afferents occurred during transmural myocardial ischemia. Reflex sympathoexcitation was quantitated by direct recording from either efferent renal (n = 20) or cardiac (n = 5) sympathetic nerves. Responses of arterial pressure and efferent sympathetic nerve activity were measured during simple occlusion of the anterior descending artery (LAD alone) and during LAD occlusion with a circumflex stenosis (LAD + CIRC). This circumflex stenosis was adjusted to abolish coronary vasodilator reserve without reducing basal flow. We observed significantly greater reflex increases in renal (32 +/- 5%) and cardiac (58 +/- 15%) nerve activity during LAD + CIRC than during LAD alone (14 +/- 6% and 8 +/- 7%, respectively). Reflex changes in renal nerve activity during LAD + CIRC were abolished by interruption of cardiac sympathetic afferent pathways (n = 5). In eight experiments, myocardial blood flow was measured during the two coronary occlusions. These experiments confirmed that LAD + CIRC elicited more transmural ischemia in the LAD distribution than did LAD alone. However, these experiments also revealed that LAD + CIRC elicited endocardial ischemia in the circumflex distribution. In five additional experiments, regional sympathetic deafferentation of the posterior left ventricle by epicardial application of 88% phenol along the atrioventricular groove had no significant effect on renal nerve responses to LAD + CIRC (36 +/- 5% increase before phenol versus 31 +/- 3% increase after phenol). These results indicate that endocardial ischemia in the circumflex distribution did not contribute to the reflex increases in nerve activity that were noted during LAD + CIRC. CONCLUSIONS. Reflex sympathoexcitation mediated by cardiac sympathetic afferents can be elicited in dogs. However, these responses are significant only during ischemia that is transmural and involves the superficial epicardial layers of the left ventricle},

METHODS: The British birth cohort of all births in 1 week in March 1958, includes information on physical activity frequency and BMI for several ages, 11-45 years. We examined relationships between activity in adolescence and trajectories of BMI between 16 years (or 23 years) and 45 years using multi-level models. Effects of change in activity on BMI and on change in BMI were tested using ANOVA. RESULTS: Physical activity at 11 years had no effect on the BMI trajectories, in males or females. More active females at 16 years gained BMI more slowly than others, by 0.007 kg/m2/year per activity category over the period 16-45 years, whereas the most active males gained BMI faster than others, by 0.005 kg/m2/year per activity category. This effect in males was not evident on the BMI trajectory from 23 to 45 years. Consistent with these analyses, change in activity was associated with change in BMI in females, e.g. females active at 16 and 42 years gained less BMI than inactive females (2.1 vs 2.5 kg/m2/10 years). Results for males were inconsistent over the time periods examined. CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity may lessen the gains in BMI from adolescence onwards, but relationships vary with age, and in later adolescence show opposite effects for males and females. Decreasing activity between adolescence and mid-adulthood in males, and inactivity in both life stages in females may increase BMI gain.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Resistance exercise (RE) is an important part of cardiac rehabilitation. However, it is not known about the low intensity of RE training that could modify the heart rate variability (HRV), muscular strength and endurance in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). AIM To investigate the effects of high repetition/low load resistance training (HR/LL-RT) program on HRV and muscular strength and endurance in CAD patients. DESIGN Randomized and controlled trial. SETTING Patients seen at the Cardiopulmonary Physical Therapy Laboratory between May 2011 and November 2013. POPULATION Twenty male patients with CAD were randomized to a training group (61.3±5.2 years) or control group (61±4.4 years). METHODS 1 repetition maximum (1-RM) maneuver, discontinuous exercise test on the leg press (DET-L), and resting HRV were performed before and after 8 weeks of HR/LL-RT on a 45° leg press. RMSSD, SD1, mean HR and ApEn indices were calculated. The HR/LL-RT program consisted of a lower limb exercise using a 45° leg press; 3 sets of 20 repetitions, two times a week. The initial load was set at 30% of the 1-RM load and the duration of the HR/LL-RT program was performed for 8 weeks. RESULTS After 8 weeks of HR/LL-RT there were significant increases of RMSSD and SD1 indices in the training group only (P<0.05). There was a significant decrease in mean HR after HR/LL-RT in the training group (P<0.05). There was a significantly higher ApEn after in the training group (P<0.05). There were significantly higher values in the training group in contrast to the control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION These results show positive improvements on HRV, as well as muscle strength and endurance in CAD patients. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT Eight weeks of HR/LL-RT is an effective sufficient to beneficially modify important outcomes as HRV, muscle strength and endurance in CAD patients.},

abstract = {This brief review describes recent advances in the areas of myocardial receptors that discharge into nonmyelinated, afferent, vagal C-flbers and the regional distribution of sympathetic postganglionic neurons to the myocardium. Complex, nonencapsulated nerve endings discharging into myelinated afferents have been known to exist for many years. More recently, however, indirect evidence for the existence of cardiac receptors that are either silent or exhibit low resting rates of activity, and discharge into slowly conducting C-type fibers, has been demonstrated. The receptors themselves have not yet been identified histologically. Cardiac receptors include subpopulations that are preferenthlly activated by chemical stimuli, including a variety of exogenous chemicals as well as prostaglandins. Another subpopulation is preferentially activated by mechanical stresses in the physiological range. Further investigation may reveal their participation in overall cardiovascular regulation, and mediation of responses to exogenous chemical stimuli. Four principal cardiac sympathetic nerves have been identified in the right thoracic region and three on the left. Most carry sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers. Stimulation of individual nerves, before and after parasympathetic blockade, results in regionally, well-defined myocardial responses.},

@article{Kingwell1994,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although heart rate variability (HRV) at 0.1 Hz has been proposed as a noninvasive clinical measure of cardiac sympathetic nerve firing, this premise has not been sufficiently validated by comparison with techniques such as microneurography and the measurement of norepinephrine spillover from the heart that more directly reflect presynaptic sympathetic activity. METHODS AND RESULTS: We compared the three techniques under conditions of effective cardiac sympathetic denervation, pure autonomic failure (n = 4), dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency (n = 1), and after cardiac transplantation (n = 9) as well as in the context of sympathetic nervous activation in cardiac failure (n = 15) and with aging (n = 10). Age-matched comparisons were made in each case with healthy individuals drawn from a pool of 52 volunteers. In pure autonomic failure and early after transplantation, cardiac norepinephrine spillover was negligible, and HRV was low. Late after transplantation, however, cardiac norepinephrine spillover returned to normal levels, and HRV remained low. In comparison to younger subjects (18 to 35 years old), older individuals (60 to 75 years old) had higher muscle sympathetic nerve activity (young, 22.9 +/- 1.9; old, 31.3 +/- 5.8 bursts per minute; P < .05) and cardiac norepinephrine spillover (young, 14.3 +/- 2.5; old, 20.1 +/- 3.0 ng/min; P < .05). In contrast, total HRV was reduced by 89%, and at 0.1 Hz it was reduced by 93% (P < .05). Cardiac failure was also characterized by elevated cardiac norepinephrine spillover (cardiac failure patients, 59 +/- 4; healthy volunteers, 18 +/- 3 ng/min; P < .01) but reduced 0.1 Hz HRV (cardiac failure patients, 49 +/- 17; healthy volunteers, 243 +/- 4 ms2; P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: HRV at 0.1 Hz depends on factors in addition to cardiac sympathetic nerve firing rates, including multiple neural reflexes, cardiac adrenergic receptor sensitivity, postsynaptic signal transduction, and electrochemical coupling, and is not directly related to cardiac norepinephrine spillover, which is a more direct measure of the sympathetic nerve firing rate.},

abstract = {Autonomic control of the heart has a significant influence over development of life threatening arrhythmias that can lead to sudden cardiac death. Sympathetic activity is known to be upregulated during these conditions and hence the sympathetic nerves present a target for treatment. However, a better understanding of the anatomy and physiology of cardiac sympathetic nerves is required for the progression of clinical interventions. This review explores the organization of the cardiac sympathetic nerves, from the preganglionic origin to the postganglionic innervations, and provides an overview of literature surrounding anti-arrhythmic therapies including thoracic sympathectomy and dorsal spinal cord stimulation. Several features of the innervation are clear. The cardiac nerves differentially supply the nodal and myocardial tissue of the heart and are dependent on activity generated in spinal neurones in the upper thoracic cord which project to synapse with ganglion cells in the stellate complex on each side. Networks of spinal interneurones determine the pattern of activity. Groups of spinal neurones selectively target specific regions of the heart but whether they exhibit a functional selectivity has still to be elucidated. Electrical or ischemic signals can lead to remodeling of nerves in the heart or ganglia. Surgical and electrical methods are proving to be clinically beneficial in reducing atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, heart failure and severe cardiac pain. This is a rapidly developing area and we need more basic understanding of how these methods work to ensure safety and reduction of side effects.},

abstract = {Background: Prior studies have consistently demonstrated that blacks have an approximate 2-fold higher incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) than whites; however, these analyses have lacked individual-level sociodemographic, medical comorbidity, and behavioral health data. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether racial differences in SCD incidence are attributable to differences in the prevalence of risk factors or rather to underlying susceptibility to fatal arrhythmias. Methods: The Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke study is a prospective, population-based cohort of adults from across the United States. Associations between race and SCD defined per National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute criteria were assessed. Results: Among 22,507 participants (9,416 blacks and 13,091 whites) without a history of clinical cardiovascular disease, there were 174 SCD events (67 whites and 107 blacks) over a median follow-up of 6.1 years (interquartile range: 4.6 to 7.3 years). The age-adjusted SCD incidence rate (per 1,000 person-years) was higher in blacks (1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4 to 2.2) compared with whites (0.7; 95% CI: 0.6 to 0.9), with an unadjusted hazard ratio of 2.35; 95% CI: 1.74 to 3.20. The association of black race with SCD risk remained significant after adjustment for sociodemographics, comorbidities, behavioral measures of health, intervening cardiovascular events, and competing risks of non-SCD mortality (hazard ratio: 1.97; 95% CI: 1.39 to 2.77). Conclusions: In a large biracial population of adults without a history of cardiovascular disease, SCD rates were significantly higher in blacks as compared with whites. These racial differences were not fully explained by demographics, adverse socioeconomic measures, cardiovascular risk factors, and behavioral measures of health.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is a common phenomenon in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and an emerging prognostic factor. Mental stress ischemia is correlated with ambulatory ischemia. However, whether it is related to angina symptoms during daily life has not been examined. METHODS: We assessed angina frequency (past month) in 98 post-myocardial infarction (MI) subjects (age 18-60 years) using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire. Patients underwent [(99m)Tc]sestamibi SPECT perfusion imaging at rest, after mental stress, and after exercise/pharmacological stress. Summed scores of perfusion abnormalities were obtained by observer-independent software. A summed difference score (SDS), the difference between stress and rest scores, was used to quantify myocardial ischemia under both stress conditions. RESULTS: The mean age was 50 years, 50% were female and 60% were non-white. After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, CAD severity, depressive, anger, and anxiety symptoms, each 1-point increase in mental stress-SDS was associated with 1.73-unit increase in the angina frequency score (95% CI: 0.09-3.37) and 17% higher odds of being in a higher angina frequency category (OR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.00-1.38). Depressive symptoms were associated with 12% higher odds of being in a higher angina frequency category (OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.03-1.21). In contrast, exercise/pharmacological stress-induced SDS was not associated with angina frequency. CONCLUSION: Among young and middle-aged post-MI patients, myocardial ischemia induced by mental stress in the lab, but not by exercise/pharmacological stress, is associated with higher frequency of retrospectively reported angina during the day. Psychosocial stressors related to mental stress ischemia may be important contributory factor to daily angina.},

abstract = {Starting from the late embryonic development, the sympathetic nervous system extensively innervates the heart and modulates its activity during the entire lifespan. The distribution of myocardial sympathetic processes is finely regulated by the secretion of limiting amounts of pro-survival neurotrophic factors by cardiac cells. Norepinephrine release by the neurons rapidly modulates myocardial electrophysiology, and increases the rate and force of cardiomyocyte contractions. Sympathetic processes establish direct interaction with cardiomyocytes, characterized by the presence of neurotransmitter vesicles and reduced cell-cell distance. Whether such contacts have a functional role in both neurotrophin- and catecholamine-dependent communication between the two cell types, is poorly understood. In this review we will address the effects of the sympathetic neuron activity on the myocardium and the hypothesis that the direct neuro-cardiac contact might have a key role both in norepinephrine and neurotrophin mediated signaling.

Short term analysis of HRV features has been investigated mostly in ECG data from normal and cardiac patients. Thus, short term HRV features may not have any relevance on the assessment of acute mental stress. In this study, we obtained ultra short term HRV features from 24 subjects during baseline stage and Stroop color word test. We validated these HRV features by showing significant differences in HRV features existed between the two stages.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Emotional stress may disproportionally affect young women with ischemic heart disease. We sought to examine whether mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI), but not exercise-induced ischemia, is more common in young women with previous myocardial infarction (MI) than in men.\n\nMETHODS: We studied 98 post-MI patients (49 women and 49 men) aged 38 to 60 years. Women and men were matched for age, MI type, and months since MI. Patients underwent technetium-99m sestamibi perfusion imaging at rest, after mental stress, and after exercise/pharmacological stress. Perfusion defect scores were obtained with observer-independent software. A summed difference score (SDS), the difference between stress and rest scores, was used to quantify ischemia under both stress conditions.\n\nRESULTS: Women 50 years or younger, but not older women, showed a more adverse psychosocial profile than did age-matched men but did not differ for conventional risk factors and tended to have less angiographic coronary artery disease. Compared with age-matched men, women 50 years or younger exhibited a higher SDS with mental stress (3.1 versus 1.5, p = .029) and had twice the rate of MSIMI (SDS ≥ 3; 52% versus 25%), whereas ischemia with physical stress did not differ (36% versus 25%). In older patients, there were no sex differences in MSIMI. The higher prevalence of MSIMI in young women persisted when adjusting for sociodemographic and life-style factors, coronary artery disease severity, and depression.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: MSIMI post-MI is more common in women 50 years or younger compared with age-matched men. These sex differences are not observed in post-MI patients who are older than 50 years.},

abstract = {The origins and organization of cardiac sympathetic postganglionic nerves in the rat were identified in the present investigation. The retrograde tracer, Diamidino Yellow, was injected into the right or left ventricles to label somata in the sympathetic chain. Analysis of all sympathetic ganglia from superior cervical ganglion through the 10th thoracic ganglion indicated that the postganglionic innervation of the rat cardiac ventricles originates bilaterally. The majority of these somata were located in the middle and inferior cervical ganglia (middle cervical-stellate ganglion complex) (approximately 92% of all labelled cells), with lesser contributions from the superior cervical and 4th through 6th thoracic ganglia. To confirm and further quantitate these findings, the middle cervical-stellate ganglion complex was removed (MC-S ganglionectomy) bilaterally or ipsilaterally from the left or right sides, and regional cardiac norepinephrine concentration (left and right atrial appendages and left and right ventricles) was analysed 7 or 28 days later. At both times after bilateral MC-S ganglionectomy, regional cardiac norepinephrine was reduced by 89% to 100%, indicating the removal of almost all cardiac noradrenergic cells of origin and possibly fibers of passage. The results of unilateral MC-S ganglionectomy experiments indicated that the atrial appendages and the left ventricle receive bilateral innervation from the middle cervical-stellate ganglion complex. However, the left middle cervical-stellate ganglion complex appears to contribute a majority of the norepinephrine to the right ventricle. Furthermore, between 7 and 28 days after contralateral MC-S ganglionectomy, atrial appendages, but not ventricles, display significant recovery of norepinephrine content. The present data demonstrate: (1) a bilateral locus of origin of cardiac sympathetic postganglionic neurons, limited longitudinally to cervical through mid-thoracic ganglia, and (2) the ability of the cardiac postganglionic innervation to regenerate after partial denervation. These results demonstrate anatomical evidence for significant bilateral integration of cardiac sympathetic activity at the level of the sympathetic ganglion in the rat. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

To date, the pathophysiological mechanisms whereby panic leads to attenuated HRV are not fully elu- cidated. We aimed to investigate the hypothesis that PD patients show pathological reactivity both in response to interoceptive and psychosocial stress in comparison to healthy individuals. We performed a controlled study on 38 patients diagnosed with PD [20 males and 18 females aged 35.55 ± 10.12 years, mean ± standard deviation] and 23 age and gender matched healthy control participants.

Statistical analyses revealed significant main effects of time for mean heart rate (HR), HF, LF (solely DEX–CRH), LFHF-ratio (solely TSST) and the RMSSD. Significant interaction effects were observed with more pronounced increases in mean HR (TSST) and LFHF-ratio (DEX–CRH) in the healthy control participants. No significant main effects of group were observed. Overall, our results indicate ‘‘normal'' HRV parameters in patients with PD. The HRV of PD patients is no worse than that of healthy control participants since the HRV profiles were similar between the study groups. The current study is one of rather rarely published studies which was unable to show an influence of PD on HRV. Implications for future studies are under discussion},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Previous studies have documented abnormalities of arterial baroreflexes in animals and patients with congestive heart failure. This study determined whether cardiopulmonary reflex control of sympathetic nerve activity was abnormal in a canine model of low-output heart failure induced by rapid ventricular pacing. METHODS AND RESULTS We stimulated mechanoreceptors throughout the cardiopulmonary region by volume expansion and left atrial mechanoreceptors selectively by inflating small balloons at the junctions of the pulmonary veins and left atrium. Responses of renal sympathetic nerve activity and left atrial and systemic arterial pressures were recorded. In the control group, 15% volume expansion raised left atrial pressure 3.5 +/- 0.8 mm Hg and resulted in a 70 +/- 8% reduction in renal nerve activity. In the heart failure group, 15% volume expansion resulted in a 6.8 +/- 3.0 mm Hg rise in left atrial pressure with only a 16 +/- 20% reduction in renal nerve activity (p < 0.01). When volume expansion was performed after pretreatment with hemorrhage to lower left atrial pressure to the normal range in the heart failure group, the markedly attenuated response in the heart failure group persisted. After vagotomy, volume expansion elicited no change in renal nerve activity. Inflation of the atrial balloons caused a 28 +/- 9% reduction in renal sympathetic nerve activity and a 13 +/- 4 mm Hg decrease in arterial pressure in the control group. Renal nerve activity (-5 +/- 3%) and mean arterial pressure (-1 +/- 1 mm Hg) did not change with balloon inflation in the heart failure group. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that dogs with low-output heart failure exhibit marked attenuation of cardiopulmonary mechanoreflex control of sympathetic nerve activity. This attenuated response is mediated via cardiac vagal afferent fibers and is due to either abnormalities in cardiopulmonary baroreceptors or abnormalities in the central nervous system.},

The phenotype of impaired parasympathetic responsiveness and sympathetic hyperactivity in experimental animal models is also well documented in large scale human studies in the setting of heart failure and myocardial infarction, and is predictive of morbidity and mortality. Despite advances in emergency revascularisation strategies for myocardial infarction, device therapy for heart failure and secondary prevention pharmacotherapies, mortality from malignant ventricular arrhythmia remains high. Patients at highest risk or those with haemodynamically significant ventricular arrhythmia can be treated with catheter ablation and implantable cardioverter defibrillators, but the morbidity and reduction in quality of life due to the burden of ventricular arrhythmia and shock therapy persists. Therefore, future therapies must aim to target the underlying pathophysiology that contributes to the generation of ventricular arrhythmia. This review explores recent advances in mechanistic research in both limbs of the autonomic nervous system and potential avenues for translation into clinical therapy. In addition, we also discuss the relationship of these findings in the context of the reported efficacy of current neuromodulatory strategies in the management of ventricular arrhythmia.},

abstract = {Acute transmural myocardial infarction has been reported to functionally denervate the normal myocardium distal to the infarcted zone by interrupting neurotransmission in axons coursing in the subepicardial region of the myocardial necrosis. To directly investigate the viability of such neurotransmission, the effects of acute transmural myocardial infarction on conduction in the intrinsic cardiac nerves overlying and distal to an experimentally induced acute transmural myocardial infarction were studied. In eight dogs, during control states electrical stimulation of the epicardium adjacent to a coronary artery produced compound action potentials in the more cranially located cardiopulmonary nerves. Thereafter, in four dogs an acute transmural myocardial infarction was produced by injecting rapidly hardening latex into a major diagonal branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Epicardial stimulation over the infarct, as well as proximal or distal to it, produced compound action potentials that conducted at normal velocities for at least 12 h postinfarction. The transmural extent of the infarct was verified with tetrazolium blue staining at the end of the experiment. In the other four dogs, compound action potentials were generated in cardiopulmonary nerves as described above and then ventricular fibrillation was produced to assess the effects of global anoxia on the function of axons coursing in cardiac nerves. Following the onset of ventricular fibrillation, compound action potentials were generated in these nerves in C fibers for up to 2 h, in B fibers for up to 4 h, and in A fibers for at least 12 h.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {Neural elements of the intrinsic cardiac nervous system transduce sensory inputs from the heart, blood vessels and other organs to ensure adequate cardiac function on a beat-to-beat basis. This inter-organ crosstalk is critical for normal function of the heart and other organs; derangements within the nervous system hierarchy contribute to pathogenesis of organ dysfunction. The role of intact cardiac nerves in development of, as well as protection against, ischemic injury is of current interest since it may involve recruitment of intrinsic cardiac ganglia. For instance, ischemic conditioning, a novel protection strategy against organ injury, and in particular remote conditioning, is likely mediated by activation of neural pathways or by endogenous cytoprotective blood-borne substances that stimulate different signalling pathways. This discovery reinforces the concept that inter-organ communication, and maintenance thereof, is key. As such, greater understanding of mechanisms and elucidation of treatment strategies is imperative to improve clinical outcomes particularly in patients with comorbidities. For instance, autonomic imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system regulation can initiate cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy that compromises cardiac stability and function. Neuromodulation therapies that directly target the intrinsic cardiac nervous system or other elements of the nervous system hierarchy are currently being investigated for treatment of different maladies in animal and human studies.},

abstract = {AIMS: The role of the vagus in the ventricle is controversial, although the vagus can protect against ventricular fibrillation (VF) via nitric oxide (NO). This study aims to determine whether the mechanisms involved are dependent on post-ganglionic release and muscarinic receptor activation. For this purpose, NO release and electrophysiological effects of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) were evaluated in relation to acetylcholine and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). In addition, the role of the coronary endothelium and afferent nerves was tested.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Using the isolated innervated rabbit heart, we measured ventricular NO release using 4,5-diaminofluorescein (DAF-2) fluorescence and ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT) during VNS after muscarinic, ganglionic, and VIP inhibition [atropine, hexamethonium, and VIP (6-28), respectively] and after Triton-X endothelial functional dysfunction. The vagal-mediated increases in NO and VFT were not significantly affected (P> 0.05) during (i) atropine perfusion [increase in NO: 196.8 ± 35.2 mV (control) vs. 156.1 ± 20.3 mV (atropine) and VFT 3.1 ± 0.5 mA (control) vs. 2.7 ± 0.4 mA (atropine)], (ii) VIP inhibition-increase in NO: 243.0 ± 42.4 mV (control) vs. 203.9 ± 28.5 mV [VIP(6-28)] and VFT 3.3 ± 0.3 mA (control) vs. 3.9 ± 0.6 mA [VIP(6-28)], or (iii) after endothelial functional dysfunction [increase in NO: 127.7 ± 31.7 mV (control) vs. 172.1 ± 31.5 mV (Triton-X) and VFT 2.6 ± 0.4 mA (control) vs. 2.5 ± 0.5 mA (Triton-X)]. However, the vagal effects were inhibited during ganglionic blockade [increase in NO: 175.1 ± 38.1 mV (control) vs. 0.6 ± 25.3 mV (hexamethonium) and VFT 3.3 ± 0.5 mA (control) vs. -0.3 ± 0.3 mA (hexamethonium)].\n\nCONCLUSIONS: We show that the vagal anti-fibrillatory action in the rabbit ventricle occurs via post-ganglionic efferent nerve fibres, independent of muscarinic receptor activation, VIP, and the endothelium. Together with our previous publications, our data support the possibility of a novel ventricular nitrergic parasympathetic innervation and highlight potential for new therapeutic targets to treat ventricular dysrhythmias.},

No previous study has assessed neighborhood poverty with hemodynamic, neuroendocrine, and immune reactivity to stress. We used data from 632 patients with coronary artery disease. Patients' residential addresses were geocoded and merged with poverty data from the 2010 American Community Survey at the census-tract level. A z-transformation was calculated to classify census tracts (neighborhoods) as either having 'high' or 'low' poverty. Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, rate-pressure product, epinephrine, interleukin-6, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were measured before and after a public speaking stress task. Multilevel models were used for repeated measures and accounting for individuals nested within census tracts. Adjusted models included demographics, lifestyle and medical risk factors, and medication use. Another set of models included propensity scores weighted by the inverse probability of neighborhood status for sex, age, race, and individual-level income. The mean age was 63 years and 173 were women. After adjusting for potential confounders, participants living in high (vs. low) poverty neighborhoods had similar hemodynamic values at rest and lower values during mental stress for systolic blood pressure (157 mmHg vs. 161 mmHg; p = 0.07), heart rate (75 beats/min vs. 78 beats/min; p = 0.02) and rate-pressure product (11839 mmHg x beat/min vs 12579 mmHg x beat/min; p = 0.01). P-values for neighborhood poverty-by-time interactions were <0.05. Results were similar in the propensity weighted models. There were no significant differences in inflammatory and epinephrine responses to mental stress based on neighborhood poverty status.

Future studies should explore whether neighborhood poverty and blunted hemodynamic response to stress translate into differences in long-term cardiovascular outcomes.},

abstract = {A very schematic summary of possible factors that affect coronary vascular resistance is illustrated in Fig. 11. These factors are mechanical, myogenic, metabolic, and neural.64 Mechanical influence is passive and is essentially determined by the extravascular compression which is important only during systole and particularly in the subendocardial layers of the left ventricular myocardium. With respect to the myogenic factor it is controversial whether it plays a role in adjustments of coronary vascular tone. Metabolic processes are possibly integrated at the level of the myocardial cell PO2 which is the resultant of oxygen supply and need, which in turn depend on the myocardial contractile activity as well as other biochemical processes. A decrease in myocardial PO2 gives rise to the release of the vasodilator metabolite adenosine. Nevertheless, other chemical factors (H+, K+, osmolarity) known to be released by the heart (which by themselves are poor and transient coronary vasodilators and whose release does not correspond with changes in coronary resistance) may play a role by modulating the coronary sensitivity to adenosine and other factors. {\textcopyright} 1975.},

All subjects underwent 1-hour Holter testing with subsequent HRV analysis before EST with MPI. The diagnostic yield of HRV analysis was compared with EST, using MPI as the gold standard for the noninvasive detection of myocardial ischemia. All subjects had intermediate pretest probability for CAD. Mean age was 62 years, 38% were women, 51% had hypertension, and 25% diabetes mellitus. HRV analysis showed superior sensitivity (77%) compared with standard EST (27%). After multivariate adjustment, HRV was independently associated with an 8.4-fold (p <0.001) increased likelihood for the detection of myocardial ischemia by MPI, whereas EST did not show a statistically significant association with a positive MPI (odds ratio 2.1; p = 0.12). Of subjects who were referred for subsequent coronary angiography, the respective sensitivities of HRV and EST for the detection of significant CAD were 73% versus 26%. Our data suggest that HRV can be used as an important noninvasive technique for the detection of myocardial ischemia in subjects without known CAD, providing superior sensitivity to conventional EST in this population.},

abstract = {Objectives. This study sought to define the effects of age and gender effects on the normal range of time domain heart rate variability (HRV) over nine decades in healthy subjects. Background. Low HRV is considered an independent marker of mortality risk. However, the age-related decline in HRV may limit its predictive value, particularly in the elderly. Delineation of the range of HRV in healthy subjects over the life span is needed. Gender- related differences in HRV also need clarification. Methods. We determined, according to decade, 24-h heart rate (HR) and HRV of 260 healthy subjects (10 to 99 years old; 112 male, 148 female) by means of five standard time domain measures: standard deviation of all normal sinus RR intervals over 24 h (SDNN), standard deviation of the averaged normal sinus RR intervals for all 5-mm segments (SDANN), mean of the standard deviations of all normal sinus RR intervals for all 5-min segments (SDNN index), root-mean-square of successive normal sinus RR interval difference (rMSSD) and the percentage of successive normal sinus RR intervals >50 ms (pNN50). Results. 1) HRV decreased with aging, the pattern of change being measure dependent. HRV (SDNN and SDANN) decreased only very gradually, reaching 60% of baseline (second-decade values) by the tenth decade. With the SDNN index, HRV decreased linearly with aging, reaching 46% of baseline by the tenth decade. Using pNN50 and rMSSD, HRV decreased most rapidly, reaching 24% and 47% of baseline, respectively, by the sixth decade and then stabilized. 2) Using the SDNN index, rMSSD and pNN50, HRV of subjects >65 years old fell below published cutpoints for increased risk of mortality in 25%, 12% and 4%, respectively. 3) At age <30 years, HRV for all measures was lower in female than male subjects. Gender differences decreased at age >30 years and disappeared at age >50 years. 4) HR also declined with aging but much more slowly. HR at age <50 years was faster in female than in male subjects. Gender differences disappeared thereafter. Conclusions. 1) Using all measures, HRV of healthy subjects declines with aging, with measure-dependent patterns. 2) Using the SDNN index, rMSSD and pNN50, HRV of healthy subjects, particularly those >65 years old, may decrease to below levels associated with increased risk of mortality. 3)Gender influences HRV. Gender differences in HRV are age and measure dependent. 4) Age and gender also affect heart rate.},

abstract = {Spontaneous activity of 226 neurons was recorded from in situ mediastinal ganglia in 10 dogs. Forty-two percent of these were active during specific phases of the cardiac cycle, primarily during systole. Cardiovascular-related activity occurred when systolic pressure was between approximately 70 and 185 mmHg (1 mmHg = 133.3 Pa) whether the pressure was altered by positive inotropic pharmacological agents or cross clamping of the aorta. Twenty percent of the identified neurons displayed respiratory-related activity which occurred during positive pressure inflation or deflation. Thirty-eight percent of the identified neurons displayed bursts of activity or sporadic activity. The activity of 17% of the identified neurons was altered by gentle mechanical distortion of localized regions of the neck, left elbow, ventral thoracic wall, ventral abdominal wall, superior vena cava, right ventricle, or aorta. In the majority of instances cardiovascular- or respiratory-related activity persisted following acute decentralization, indicating that neurons in mediastinal ganglia can function in the absence of influences of central nervous system neurons. Five percent of the identified neurons were activated by single 1-4 ms, 10-20 V stimuli delivered at 0.5 Hz to the nerves connected with either the cranial or the caudal poles of the mediastinal ganglion or the ansae. These neurons were activated after a fixed latency when 0.5 Hz was used and in most instances when 10 Hz was used. These data indicate that 5% or less of the neurons identified projected axons out of the mediastinal ganglia investigated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Background: Type A or coronary-prone behavior is considered a possible risk factor for the development of coronary heart disease. Premature development of coronary atherosclerosis is suspected to play a role. Utilizing electron beam computed tomography, one can accurately determine the degree of coronary artery calcification, which is reflective of coronary atherosclerosis. Methods: We performed a study of 35 men who had no clinical evidence of coronary heart disease. Twenty exhibited severe type A behavior and 15 exhibited type B behavior. All subjects were given an Electron Beam Computed Tomography scan of their coronary arteries and a treadmill electrocardiogram. Results: Eight of the 20 (40%) type A subjects were found to have coronary calcification compared to none of the type B subjects (P=0.005). The correlation coefficient between type A score and coronary calcium score was 0.39 (P=0.09). Conclusions: The pathophysiology by which type A behavior increases the risk for coronary heart disease may involve the premature development of coronary atherosclerosis. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Emerging data suggest that young women with coronary heart disease (CHD) are disproportionally vulnerable to the adverse cardiovascular effects of psychological stress. We hypothesized that younger, but not older, women with stable CHD are more likely than their male peers to develop mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI). METHODS AND RESULTS We studied 686 patients (191 women) with stable coronary heart disease (CHD). Patients underwent (99m)Tc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging at rest and with both mental (speech task) and conventional (exercise/pharmacological) stress testing. We compared quantitative (by automated software) and visual parameters of inducible ischemia between women and men and assessed age as an effect modifier. Women had a more-adverse psychosocial profile than men whereas there were few differences in medical history and CHD risk factors. Both quantitative and visual indicators of ischemia with mental stress were disproportionally larger in younger women. For each 10 years of decreasing age, the total reversibility severity score with mental stress was 9.6 incremental points higher (interaction, P<0.001) and the incidence of MSIMI was 82.6% higher (interaction, P=0.004) in women than in men. Incidence of MSIMI in women ≤50 years was almost 4-fold higher than in men of similar age and older patients. These results persisted when adjusting for sociodemographic and medical risk factors, psychosocial factors, and medications. There were no significant sex differences in inducible ischemia with conventional stress. CONCLUSIONS Young women with stable CHD are susceptible to MSIMI, which could play a role in the prognosis of this group.},

abstract = {The precise mechanism of the vagus in opposing adrenergic influences on cardiac vulnerability has not been defined. In the present investigation, cholinergic stimulation was produced by administering the selective muscarinic agent methacholine (MCh) and ventricular vulnerability was assessed by measuring the repetitive extrasystole (RE) threshold. MCh produced a sustained 98 +/- 12% (P less than 0.0001) increase in the RE threshold; the increase was abolished by concurrent infusion of atropine (0.2 mg/kg). When MCh was administered during beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol, however, no further increase in RE threshold occurred beyond that resulting from propranolol alone. Infusion of norepinephrine (NE), in a dose insufficient to provoke systemic hypertension, significantly lowered the vulnerable period threshold. This decrease was completely abolished by concurrent vagosympathetic stimulation (VS). It is concluded that VS affects ventricular vulnerability through its muscarinic action and that the protection against VF is in part due to modulation of neural and humoral beta-adrenergic inputs.},

abstract = {The aims of the study were to determine how aggregates of intrinsic cardiac (IC) neurons transduce the cardiovascular milieu versus responding to changes in central neuronal drive and to determine IC network interactions subsequent to induced neural imbalances in the genesis of atrial fibrillation (AF). Activity from multiple IC neurons in the right atrial ganglionated plexus was recorded in eight anaesthetized canines using a 16-channel linear microelectrode array. Induced changes in IC neuronal activity were evaluated in response to: (1) focal cardiac mechanical distortion; (2) electrical activation of cervical vagi or stellate ganglia; (3) occlusion of the inferior vena cava or thoracic aorta; (4) transient ventricular ischaemia, and (5) neurally induced AF. Low level activity (ranging from 0 to 2.7 Hz) generated by 92 neurons was identified in basal states, activities that displayed functional interconnectivity. The majority (56%) of IC neurons so identified received indirect central inputs (vagus alone: 25%; stellate ganglion alone: 27%; both: 48%). Fifty per cent transduced the cardiac milieu responding to multimodal stressors applied to the great vessels or heart. Fifty per cent of IC neurons exhibited cardiac cycle periodicity, with activity occurring primarily in late diastole into isovolumetric contraction. Cardiac-related activity in IC neurons was primarily related to direct cardiac mechano-sensory inputs and indirect autonomic efferent inputs. In response to mediastinal nerve stimulation, most IC neurons became excessively activated; such network behaviour preceded and persisted throughout AF. It was concluded that stochastic interactions occur among IC local circuit neuronal populations in the control of regional cardiac function. Modulation of IC local circuit neuronal recruitment may represent a novel approach for the treatment of cardiac disease, including atrial arrhythmias. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: An acute psychological stress can precipitate ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the physiologic mechanisms by which these effects occur are not entirely clear. Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia occurs in a significant percentage of the CAD population. It is unknown if the proarrhythmic effects of psychological stress are mediated through the development of myocardial ischemia.\n\nOBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of psychological stress on QT dispersion (QTd) among CAD patients and whether these effects are mediated via the development of myocardial ischemia.\n\nMETHODS: Psychological stress was induced using a public speaking task. Twelve-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) were recorded at rest, during mental stress, and during recovery. QTd was calculated as the difference between the longest and the shortest QT interval in the 12-lead ECG. Rest-stress myocardial perfusion imaging was also performed to detect mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia.\n\nRESULTS: Mental stress induced a significant increase in QTd compared to the resting condition (P < 0.001). This effect persisted beyond the first 10 minutes of recovery (P < 0.001). QTd was significantly associated with the development of mental stress ischemia with ischemic patients having significantly higher QTd during mental stress than nonischemic patients (P = 0.006). This finding remained significant after controlling for possible confounding factors (P = 0.01).\n\nCONCLUSION: An acute psychological stress induces a significant increase in QTd, which persists for more than 10 minutes after the cessation of the stressor. This effect seems to be, at least partially, mediated by the development of mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Heart Association, Inc.Rationale: Catecholamines increase cardiac contractility, but exposure to high concentrations or prolonged exposures can cause cardiac injury. A recent study demonstrated that a single subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (ISO; 200 mg/kg) in mice causes acute myocyte death (8%-10%) with complete cardiac repair within a month. Cardiac regeneration was via endogenous cKit+ cardiac stem cell-mediated new myocyte formation. Objective: Our goal was to validate this simple injury/regeneration system and use it to study the biology of newly forming adult cardiac myocytes. Methods and Results: C57BL/6 mice (n=173) were treated with single injections of vehicle, 200 or 300 mg/kg ISO, or 2 daily doses of 200 mg/kg ISO for 6 days. Echocardiography revealed transiently increased systolic function and unaltered diastolic function 1 day after single ISO injection. Single ISO injections also caused membrane injury in ≈10% of myocytes, but few of these myocytes appeared to be necrotic. Circulating troponin I levels after ISO were elevated, further documenting myocyte damage. However, myocyte apoptosis was not increased after ISO injury. Heart weight to body weight ratio and fibrosis were also not altered 28 days after ISO injection. Single- or multiple-dose ISO injury was not associated with an increase in the percentage of 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine-labeled myocytes. Furthermore, ISO injections did not increase new myocytes in cKit+/Cre×R-GFP transgenic mice. Conclusions: A single dose of ISO causes injury in ≈10% of the cardiomyocytes. However, most of these myocytes seem to recover and do not elicit cKit+ cardiac stem cell-derived myocyte regeneration.},

abstract = {Introduction: About one-half of sudden cardiac deaths occur in those without known CAD suggesting the need for better risk-stratification tests. Autonomic dysfunction, measured by low heart rate variability (HRV), can occur with myocardial ischemia. Testing for low HRV may help to identify high-risk, asymptomatic individuals. The association of low HRV with ischemia may also be greatest during the morning hours, when cardiac events (MI, sudden death) are most likely to be triggered. Hypothesis: In a cohort of veteran males with no known CAD, subclinical myocardial ischemia is associated with autonomic dysfunction as measured by low HRV; this association is greatest during morning hours. Methods: We evaluated 24-hour ambulatory ECGs in middle-aged twins without known CAD from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry, and calculated frequency domain and non-linear (Dyx) HRV metrics. All subjects underwent [13N]-ammonia positron emission tomography with adenosine stress, with ischemia defined as greater than 5% perfusion deficit. Mixed models were used to compare HRV between ischemic and non-ischemic subjects in 1-hour intervals, and morning hours were 6 AM until 10 AM. Results: Data on 276 twin subjects were analyzed; the mean age (SD) was 53 (3) and 55 (20%) had ischemia. HRV was significantly different between ischemic and non-ischemic twins during morning hours (figure 1), with the largest magnitude difference occurring with Dyx at 7 AM. Each SD decrease in Dyx associated with an OR for ischemia of 4.8 (95% CI, 1.5 — 15.8). Dyx in morning hours remained significant in a subgroup of pairs discordant for ischemia and after risk factor adjustment. Significant differences by ischemia status were noted for low-frequency and very-low-frequency HRV. Conclusions: Lower HRV is strongly associated with subclinical myocardial ischemia primarily during morning hours. More research regarding this circadian autonomic vulnerability and its clinical implications are warranted.},

abstract = {AIMS:The density HRV parameter Dyx is a new heart rate variability (HRV) measure based on multipole analysis of the Poincar{\'{e}} plot obtained from RR interval time series, deriving information from both the time and frequency domain. Preliminary results have suggested that the parameter may provide new predictive information on mortality in survivors of acute myocardial infarction (MI). This study compares the prognostic significance of Dyx to that of traditional linear and nonlinear measures of HRV.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS:In the Nordic ICD pilot study, patients with an acute MI were screened with 2D echocardiography and 24-hour Holter recordings. The study was designed to assess the power of several HRV measures to predict mortality. Dyx was tested in a subset of 206 consecutive Danish patients with analysable Holter recordings. After a median follow-up of 8.5 years 70 patients had died. Of all traditional and multipole HRV parameters, reduced Dyx was the most powerful predictor of all-cause mortality (HR 2.4; CI 1.5 to 3.8; P < 0.001). After adjustment for known risk markers, such as age, diabetes, ejection fraction, previous MI and hypertension, Dyx remained an independent predictor of mortality (P = 0.02). Reduced Dyx also predicted cardiovascular death (P < 0.01) and sudden cardiovascular death (P = 0.05). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, Dyx significantly predicted mortality in patients both with and without impaired left ventricular systolic function (P < 0.0001).\n\nCONCLUSION:The new nonlinear HRV measure Dyx is a promising independent predictor of mortality in a long-term follow-up study of patients surviving a MI, irrespectively of left ventricular systolic function.},

abstract = {The ability to quantify the quality of cardiovascular care critically depends on the translation of recommendations for high-quality care into the measurement of that care. As payers and regulatory agencies increasingly seek to quantify healthcare quality, the implications of the measurement process on practicing physicians are likely to grow. This statement describes the methodology by which the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association approach creating performance measures and devising techniques for quantifying those aspects of care that directly reflect the quality of cardiovascular care. Methods for defining target populations, identifying dimensions of care, synthesizing the literature, and operationalizing the process of selecting measures are proposed. It is hoped that new sets of measures will be created through the implementation of this approach, and consequently, through the use of such measurement sets in the context of quality improvement efforts, the quality of cardiovascular care will improve. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation and the American Heart Association, Inc.},

abstract = {Sudden cardiac death (SCD) from cardiac arrest is a major international public health problem accounting for an estimated 15%-20% of all deaths. Although resuscitation rates are generally improving throughout the world, the majority of individuals who experience a sudden cardiac arrest will not survive. SCD most often develops in older adults with acquired structural heart disease, but it also rarely occurs in the young, where it is more commonly because of inherited disorders. Coronary heart disease is known to be the most common pathology underlying SCD, followed by cardiomyopathies, inherited arrhythmia syndromes, and valvular heart disease. During the past 3 decades, declines in SCD rates have not been as steep as for other causes of coronary heart disease deaths, and there is a growing fraction of SCDs not due to coronary heart disease and ventricular arrhythmias, particularly among certain subsets of the population. The growing heterogeneity of the pathologies and mechanisms underlying SCD present major challenges for SCD prevention, which are magnified further by a frequent lack of recognition of the underlying cardiac condition before death. Multifaceted preventative approaches, which address risk factors in seemingly low-risk and known high-risk populations, will be required to decrease the burden of SCD. In this Compendium, we review the wide-ranging spectrum of epidemiology underlying SCD within both the general population and in high-risk subsets with established cardiac disease placing an emphasis on recent global trends, remaining uncertainties, and potential targeted preventive strategies.},

The norepinephrine content of the left ventricles of 11 monkeys (four rhesus and seven cynomolgus) was 1391 +/- 362 ng/gm (+/-SD) with a definite gradient from base (highest) to apex (lowest concentration). Dopamine and epinephrine were present in much lower concentrations (51.8 +/- 24.5 ng/gm and 59.2 +/- 20.0 ng/gm, respectively), but were similarly distributed throughout the left ventricle. There was considerable variation in norepinephrine concentration between animals, but the dopamine/norepinephrine ratio was very consistent within a given animal, averaging 3.7% +/- 1.4%. These values are probably indicative of what normal concentrations of catecholamines are likely to be in humans, and provide a basis for interpretation of results obtained in disease studies.},

abstract = {Decreased heart rate (HR) variability is an independent risk factor for mortality in cardiac populations. Clinical depression has also been associated with adverse outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). This study tests the hypothesis that depressed patients with CAD have decreased HR variability compared with nondepressed CAD patients. Nineteen patients with angiographically documented CAD and either major or minor depression were compared with a sample of nondepressed CAD patients according to age, sex, and smoking status. All patients underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring, and the standard deviation of all normal-to-normal intervals was used as the primary index of HR variability. HR variability was significantly lower in depressed than nondepressed patients (90 ± 35 vs 117 ± 26 ms; p < 0.01), even after adjusting for relevant covariates. Thus, decreased HR variability may help explain the increased risk for cardiac mortality and morbidity in depressed CAD patients. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

@article{Shimizu1998,
abstract = {BACKGROUND This study examines the cellular basis for the phenotypic appearance of broad-based T waves, increased transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR), and torsade de pointes (TdP) induced by beta-adrenergic agonists under conditions mimicking the LQT1 form of the congenital long-QT syndrome. METHODS AND RESULTS A transmural ECG and transmembrane action potentials from epicardial, M, and endocardial cells were recorded simultaneously from an arterially perfused wedge of canine left ventricle. Chromanol 293B, a specific IKs blocker, dose-dependently (1 to 100 micromol/L) prolonged the QT interval and action potential duration (APD90) of the 3 cell types but did not widen the T wave, increase TDR, or induce TdP. Isoproterenol 10 to 100 nmol/L in the continued presence of chromanol 293B 30 micromol/L abbreviated the APD90 of epicardial and endocardial cells but not that of the M cell, resulting in widening of the T wave and a dramatic accentuation of TDR. Spontaneous as well as programmed electrical stimulation (PES)-induced TdP was observed only after exposure to the IKs blocker and isoproterenol. Therapeutic concentrations of propranolol (0.5 to 1 micromol/L) prevented the actions of isoproterenol to increase TDR and to induce TdP. Mexiletine 2 to 20 micromol/L abbreviated the APD90 of M cells more than that of epicardial and endocardial cells, thus diminishing TDR and the effect of isoproterenol to induce TdP. CONCLUSIONS This experimental model of LQT1 indicates that a deficiency of IKs alone does not induce TdP but that the addition of beta-adrenergic influence predisposes the myocardium to the development of TdP by increasing transmural dispersion of repolarization, most likely as a result of a large augmentation of residual IKs in epicardial and endocardial cells but not in M cells, in which IKs is intrinsically weak. Our data provide a mechanistic understanding of the cellular basis for the therapeutic actions of beta-adrenergic blockers in LQT1 and suggest that sodium channel block with class IB antiarrhythmic agents may be effective in suppressing TdP in LQT1, as they are in LQT2 and LQT3, as well as in acquired (drug-induced) forms of the long-QT syndrome.},

abstract = {Dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system has been implicated in the development of hypertension. Heart rate variability is a noninvasive tool to quantitatively estimate cardiac autonomic activity and has been used to document decreased cardiac autonomic activity in hypertension. The ability of decreased heart rate variability to predict incident hypertension has not been well studied, and there are no studies of whether hypertension leads to changes in heart rate variability. We investigated the temporal sequence linking hypertension, blood pressure, and heart rate variability in a population-based cohort of 11 061 individuals aged 45 to 54 years at baseline. Individuals with hypertension had decreased heart rate variability at baseline, and this association was present across the full blood pressure range. Among 7099 individuals without hypertension at baseline, low heart rate variability predicted greater risk of incident hypertension over 9 years of follow-up. The hazard ratio (95% confidence interval {[CI])} for the lowest compared with the highest quartile of the standard deviation of normal-to-normal {R-R} intervals was 1.24 (95% {CI,} 1.10–1.40), for the root mean square of successive differences in normal-to-normal {R-R} intervals was 1.36 (95% {CI,} 1.21–1.54), and for {R-R} interval was 1.44 (95% {CI,} 1.27–1.63). Over 9 years, there was no measurable difference in the rate of change in heart rate variability among those with and without hypertension, although the differences in heart rate variability at follow-up were smaller than those at baseline. These findings thus support the thesis that the autonomic nervous system is involved in the development of hypertension, yet suggest that differences in the autonomic profile of hypertensives and normotensives do not increase with time.},

abstract = {Objective To examine the independent association between heart rate variability (HRV) and cognitive performance , in a nationally representative population study of older adults. Methods Cross-sectional analysis of wave 1 data from the Irish longitudinal study on ageing (TILDA) was performed. A subset of 4,763 participants who underwent ECG recording during resting and paced breathing periods were used for the analysis. HRV indices were divided into quintiles for comparison of values and cognitive performance was defined using the Montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA) score. Multivariate linear regression was used to model the association between cognition and different quintiles of each HRV index, after adjustment for covariates. Results The mean age was 61.7 ± 8.3 years and 2,618 (55 %) were female. Lower quintiles of SDNN (P = 0.01-paced), LF (P = 0.001-paced), and LF:HF ratio (P = 0.049-paced) were significantly associated with lower MOCA scores (during both recording periods), independent of confounders. Sub-domains of MOCA responsible for the relationship were predominantly memory recall and language. Interpretation Reduced HRV is significantly associated with lower cognitive performance at a population level in people aged 50 and older. This further strengthens the relationship between autonomic dysfunction and cognitive disorders.},

abstract = {There is a bidirectional relationship between affective disorders and cardiovascular abnormalities, often described as a downward spiral, whereas major depressive disorders (MDD, and anxiety disorders) significantly increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (CVD); CVD are also associated with increased risk of developing MDD (and anxiety disorders). Moreover, the prognosis and progression of CVD is significantly worsened in the presence of MDD. Heart rate variability (HRV) has often been suggested as a potential mediator in this comorbidity. In this review, we discuss HRV alterations in MDD. However, we mainly focus on the direct relationship between HRV alterations and psychiatric symptoms, rather than its relationship with CVD, as this has been reviewed elsewhere. After a general introduction to HRV and how it can be measured, we review how HRV is altered in MDD. We subsequently describe how antidepressant drugs affect HRV, showing that some classes (such as tricyclics) generally worsen HRV, whereas others (most notably selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) have a more positive influence. We also review the effects of several other treatments, with a special focus on vagal nerve stimulation, finishing with some further considerations and recommendation for further research, both in humans and animals., Copyright (C) 2018 YEAR Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Cardiac neuronal distribution and function can be imaged with standard cameras and PET using radiolabeled analogs of norepinephrine. Postsynaptic -adrenergic receptor distribution and density can be determined using PET. Multiple imaging studies of the presynaptic component have reported that those individuals with the lowest retention or fastest washout of the radiolabeled analogs have a much greater annual mortality than do those with greater retention or slower washout rate. The results of some studies have suggested that the image abnormalities are better predictors of death than are more common predictors of outcome such as ejection fraction, heart rate variability, and microvolt T-wave alternans. The variability between these studies makes it unclear which measure of presynaptic dysfunction is the most predictive. -Receptor imaging has not been evaluated as extensively as a prognostic tool as has presynaptic imaging.

Heart signal is a non-stationary signal; thus, it is utmost important to study the variability of heart signal.

The standards of measurements, physiological interpretation and clinical use for HRV that are most often used were described in many researcher papers, however, remain complex issues are fraught with pitfalls. This paper presents one of the nonlinear techniques to analyze HRV. It discusses many points like, what Poincar{\'{e}} plot is and how Poincar{\'{e}} plot works; also, Poincar{\'{e}} plot's merits especially in HRV. Besides, it discusses the limitation of Poincar{\'{e}} cause of standard deviation SD1, SD2 and how to overcome this limitation by using complex correlation measure (CCM). The CCM is most sensitive to changes in temporal structure of the Poincar{\'{e}} plot as compared toSD1 and SD2.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE This study investigated whether short-term exposure to a passive online software application of purported subtle energy technology would affect heart rate variability (HRV) and associated autonomic nervous system measures. METHODS This was a randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled clinical trial (RCT). The study took place in a nonprofit laboratory in Emeryville, California. Twenty healthy, nonsmoking subjects (16 females), aged 40-75 years, participated. Quantum Code Technology™ (QCT), a purported subtle energy technology, was delivered through a passive software application (Heart+ App) on a smartphone placed <1 m from subjects who were seated and reading a catalog. HRV was measured for 5 min in triplicate for each condition via finger plethysmography using a Food and Drug Administration medically approved HRV measurement device. Measurements were made at baseline and 35 min following exposure to the software applications. The following parameters were calculated and analyzed: heart rate, total power, standard deviation node-to-node, root mean square sequential difference, low frequency to high frequency ratio (LF/HF), low frequency (LF), and high frequency (HF). RESULTS Paired samples t-tests showed that for the Heart+ App, mean LF/HF decreased (p = 9.5 × 10-4), while mean LF decreased in a trend (p = 0.06), indicating reduced sympathetic dominance. Root mean square sequential difference increased for the Heart+ App, showing a possible trend (p = 0.09). Post-pre differences in LF/HF for sham compared with the Heart+ App were also significant (p < 0.008) by independent t-test, indicating clinical relevance. CONCLUSIONS Significant beneficial changes in mean LF/HF, along with possible trends in mean LF and root mean square sequential difference, were observed in subjects following 35 min exposure to the Heart+ App that was working in the background on an active smartphone untouched by the subjects. This may be the first RCT to show that specific frequencies of a purported non-Hertzian type of subtle energy conveyed by software applications broadcast from personal electronic devices can be bioactive and beneficially impact autonomic nervous system balance.},

abstract = {Vital exhaustion, defined as excessive fatigue, feelings of demoralization, and increased irritability, has been identified as a risk factor for incident and recurrent cardiac events, but there are no population-based prospective studies of this association in US samples. We examined the predictive value of vital exhaustion for incident myocardial infarction or fatal coronary heart disease in middle-aged men and women in 4 US communities. Participants were 12,895 black or white men and women enrolled in the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities (ARIC) study cohort and followed for the occurrence of cardiac morbidity and mortality from 1990 through 2002 (maximum follow-up 13.0 years). Vital exhaustion was assessed using the 21-item Maastricht Questionnaire and scores were partitioned into approximate quartiles for statistical analyses. High vital exhaustion (fourth quartile) predicted adverse cardiac events in age-, gender-, and race-center-adjusted analyses (1.69, 95% confidence interval 1.40 to 2.05) and in analyses further adjusted for educational level, body mass index, plasma low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking status, and pack-years of cigarette smoking (1.46, 95% confidence interval 1.20 to 1.79). Risk for adverse cardiac events increased monotonically from the first through the fourth quartile of vital exhaustion. Probabilities of adverse cardiac events over time were significantly higher in people with high vital exhaustion compared to those with low exhaustion (p = 0.002). In conclusion, vital exhaustion predicts long-term risk for adverse cardiac events in men and women, independent of established biomedical risk factors. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Notes that depression in patients with cardiovascular disease is a significant risk factor for developing symptomatic and fatal ischemic heart disease. Moreover, depressed patients have a higher than expected rate of sudden cardiovascular death. Therefore, appropriate treatment of patients with depression and cardiovascular disease cannot be restricted to considerations of either depression or cardiovascular disease in isolation. The tricyclic antidepressants have various effects on the cardiovascular system, including Type IA antiarrhythmic activity that has been associated with an increased risk of mortality in post-myocardial infarction patients. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are not associated with adverse cardiac effects. On the basis of this favorable cardiovascular profile, the SSRIs should therefore be the preferred choice for the treatment of most patients with comorbid depression and cardiovascular disease. Investigation of putative pathophysiologic mechanisms linking depression and cardiovascular mortality, such as the role of platelet activation, will form the basis for further investigation of antidepressant treatments in order to establish if the antidepressants have a beneficial effect on the prognosis of cardiovascular diseases.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the present paper, we describe a model of neurovisceral integration in which a set of neural structures involved in cognitive, affective, and autonomic regulation are related to heart rate variability (HRV) and cognitive performance. METHODS: We detail the pathways involved in the neural regulation of the cardiovascular system and provide pharmacological and neuroimaging data in support of the neural structures linking the central nervous system to HRV in humans. We review a number of studies from our group showing that individual differences in HRV are related to performance on tasks associated with executive function and prefrontal cortical activity. These studies include comparisons of executive- and nonexecutive-function tasks in healthy participants, in both threatening and nonthreatening conditions. In addition, we show that manipulating resting HRV levels is associated with changes in performance on executive-function tasks. We also examine the relationship between HRV and cognitive performance in ecologically valid situations using a police shooting simulation and a naval navigation simulation. Finally, we review our studies in anxiety patients, as well as studies examining psychopathy. CONCLUSION: These findings in total suggest an important relationship among cognitive performance, HRV, and prefrontal neural function that has important implications for both physical and mental health. Future studies are needed to determine exactly which executive functions are associated with individual differences in HRV in a wider range of situations and populations.},

abstract = {ÐThis review focuses on that most engaging feature of the sympathetic nervous system, its rhythmicity. In particular examining the nature of sympathetic nerve activity (SNA), its characteristics, the frequencies of these rhythms and possible mechanisms responsible for their generation. Sympathetic activity can be thought of as a complex output of the central nervous system providing subtle control over end organ function. This control is exerted in a number of frequency bands including rhythms related to the cardiac and respiratory cycles, 10 Hz, and between 0.2 and 0.4 Hz. The generation and control over the occurrence of each of these rhythms is likely to be quite separate. Although aerent feedback from sources such as baroreceptors can explain some of the rhythmical properties in each case there is good evidence for inherent generation of aspects of these rhythms. A variety of brainstem cell groups are thought to be involved in their generation with the rostral ventrolateral medulla, although unlikely to be solely responsible for tone generation, an important regulator of overall activity. SNA also varies in the number of nerves recruited to {\textregistered}re in each synchronized discharge. Little is known about this control other than it appears to be quite separate from the control over the timing of discharges. Spinal cord mechanisms are possibly involved. SNA frequencies above 0.7 Hz do not appear to directly induce oscillations in innervated vasculature, however, are likely to contribute to setting the level of vasoconstrictive tone. Slower frequencies appear to directly cause oscillations in blood ¯ow. #},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV) is traditionally derived from RR interval time series of electrocardiography (ECG). Photoplethysmography (PPG) also reflects the cardiac rhythm since the mechanical activity of the heart is coupled to its electrical activity. Thus, theoretically, PPG can be used for determining the interval between successive heartbeats and heart rate variability. However, the PPG wave lags behind the ECG signal by the time required for transmission of pulse wave. In this study, finger-tip PPG and standard lead II ECG were recorded for five minutes from 10 healthy subjects at rest. The results showed a high correlation (median = 0.97) between the ECG-derived RR intervals and PPG-derived peak-to-peak (PP) intervals. PP variability was accurate (0.1 ms) as compared to RR variability. The time domain, frequency domain and Poincar{\'{e}} plot HRV parameters computed using RR interval method and PP interval method showed no significant differences (p < 0.05). The error analysis also showed insignificant differences between the HRV indices obtained by the two methods. Bland-Altman analysis showed high degree of agreement between the two methods for all the parameters of HRV. Thus, HRV can also be reliably estimated from the PPG based PP interval method.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction is a putative underlying mechanism for increased cardiovascular disease risk in individuals with psychiatric disorders. Previous studies suggest that this risk may be related to psychotropic medication use. In the present study we systematically reviewed and analyzed published studies of heart rate variability (HRV), measuring ANS output, to determine the effect of psychiatric illness and medication use. METHODS We searched for studies comparing HRV in physically healthy adults with a diagnosed psychiatric disorder to controls and comparing HRV pre- and post-treatment with a psychotropic medication. RESULTS In total, 140 case-control (mood, anxiety, psychosis, dependent disorders, k = 151) and 30 treatment (antidepressants, antipsychotics; k = 43) studies were included. We found that HRV was reduced in all patient groups compared to controls (Hedges g = -0.583) with a large effect for psychotic disorders (Hedges g = -0.948). Effect sizes remained highly significant for medication-free patients compared to controls across all disorders. Smaller and significant reductions in HRV were observed for specific antidepressants and antipsychotics. LIMITATIONS Study quality significantly moderated effect sizes in case-control analyses, underscoring the importance of assessing methodological quality when interpreting HRV findings. CONCLUSION Combined findings confirm substantial reductions in HRV across psychiatric disorders, and these effects remained significant even in medication-free individuals. Reductions in HRV may therefore represent a significant mechanism contributing to elevated cardiovascular risk in individuals with psychiatric disorders. The negative impact of specific medications on HRV suggest increased risk for cardiovascular disease in these groups, highlighting a need for treatment providers to consider modifiable cardiovascular risk factors to attenuate this risk.},

In eight dogs with latex-induced TMI, bilateral ansae subclaviae stimulation shortened ERP at all 45 apical and basal test sites before latex injection. After latex injection, ERP shortening was unchanged at all 15 basal sites but was eliminated (less than or equal to 2 msec shortening) at three apical sites in 5-20 minutes and at 14 of 30 apical sites 30-180 minutes after latex injection. At the remaining 13 apical sites, ERP shortening was not eliminated but attenuated significantly in 5-180 minutes. ERP shortening induced by infused norepinephrine (0.20-0.25 microgram/kg/min) did not differ between basal and apical test sites 3-4 hours after latex injection; that is, no supersensitivity occurred. Of six dogs with TMI produced by ligation of multiple coronary arteries without latex injection, ERP shortening induced by efferent sympathetic neural stimulation was eliminated at 10 apical sites in four dogs over a period of 3 hours. At 14 apical sites that did not show denervation in these six dogs, ERP shortening was unchanged. In seven dogs with latex-induced TMI, bilateral vagal stimulation lengthened ERP at all 40 apical and basal test sites before latex injection. Vagally induced ERP lengthening was unchanged at all 13 basal sites after latex injection. ERP lengthening was eliminated (less than or equal to 1 msec lengthening) at four of 27 apical sites in 5-20 minutes and at 13 apical sites 30-180 minutes after latex injection. At the remaining 10 apical sites, ERP lengthening was not eliminated but decreased significantly 3 hours after latex injection. Of nine dogs with ligation-induced NTMI, five dogs showed elimination of vagally induced ERP lengthening at eight apical sites in 3 hours after ligation. ERP lengthening induced by vagal stimulation was unchanged at all 17 basal sites in nine dogs with NTMI. We conclude that TMI produced by latex injection and ligation of multiple coronary arteries produces heterogeneous loss of efferent sympathetic innervation in noninfarcted apical sites as early as 5-20 minutes after coronary occlusion with more complete denervation occurring over time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {This study analyzed, with spectral techniques, the effects of atenolol or metroprolol on RR interval variability in 20 patients 4 weeks after the first uncomplicated myocardial infarction. Beta blocker-induced bradycardia was associated with a significant increase in the average 24 hour values of RR variance (from 13,886 ± 1,479 to 16,728 ± 1,891 ms2) and of the normalized power of the high-frequency component (from 22 ± 1 to 28 ± 2 normalized units), whereas the low-frequency component was greatly reduced (from 60 ± 3 to 50 ± 3 normalized units). When considering day and nighttime separately, the effects of both drugs were more pronounced in the daytime. In addition, a marked attenuation was observed in the circadian variation of the low-frequency component after $\beta$ blockade. As a result, the early morning increase of the spectral index of sympathetic modulation was no longer detectable. These results indicate that $\beta$-blocker administration has important effects on RR interval variability and on its spectral components. The observed reduction in signs of sympathetic activation and the increase in vagal tone after $\beta$ blockade help to explain the beneficial effects of these drugs after myocardial infarction. However, the potential clinical relevance of the increase in RR variance remains to be established. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {Patients with recurrent unexplained syncope may have cardioinhibitory and vasodepressor responses provokable with head-up tilt with or without exogenous beta-adrenergic stimulation. Although these responses are believed to be neurally mediated, the neural mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Numerous studies have documented peripheral vasodilation, hypotension, and bradycardia at the time of syncope and several case reports have shown sudden withdrawal of vasoconstrictor sympathetic neural outflow to skeletal muscle in human subjects. In cats and rats, a similar response can be provoked with hemorrhage and is prevented by interruption of cardiac vagal C-fiber afferents. In dogs, however, section of these fibers does not prevent the development of a vasodepressor response. The provocation of vasodepressor syncope during nitroprusside infusion in a heart transplant recipient with presumed ventricular denervation also suggests that cardiac afferent nerves may not be required for the development of vasodepressor responses in humans. Other potential mechanisms include release of endogenous opioids or nitric oxide that may inhibit sympathetic nerve firing, and primary central nervous system activation (as in partial seizures) that triggers cardioinhibitory and vasodepressor responses. This article reviews our current understanding of the mechanisms involved in the development of neurally mediated syncope.},

abstract = {Circadian Profile of Heart Rate Variability. INTRODUCTION: Although heart rate variability (HRV) has been established as a tool to study cardiac autonomic activity, almost no data are available on the circadian patterns of HRV in healthy subjects aged 20 to 70 years. METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated 166 healthy volunteers (81 women and 85 men; age 42 +/- 15 years, range 20-70) without evidence of cardiac disease. Time-domain HRV parameters were determined from 24-hour Holter monitoring and calculated as hourly mean values and mean 24-hour values. All volunteers were fully mobile, awoke around 7 A.M., and had 6 to 8 hours of sleep. Circadian profiles of vagus-associated HRV parameters revealed a marked day-night pattern, with a peak at nighttime and a plateau at daytime. The characteristic nocturnal peak and the day-night amplitude diminished with aging by decade. Estimates of overall HRV (geometric triangular index [TI], SD of NN intervals [SDNN]) and long-term components of HRV (SD of the averages of NN intervals for all 5-min segments [SDANN]) were low at nighttime and increased in the morning hours. There was a significant decline of 24-hour values of all HRV parameters (P < 0.001) and a strong negative correlation (P < 0.001) with increasing age. Mean 24-hour RR interval (P < 0.001), SDNN, mean SD of NN intervals for all 5-minute intervals (SDNNi), and SDANN (all P < 0.01) were significantly higher in men. Younger men also exhibited significantly higher values for vagus-associated parameters (root mean square successive difference [rMSSD], P < 0.05; SDNNi, P < 0.01); however, gender differences diminished with increasing age. CONCLUSION: Normal aging is associated with a constant decline of cardiac vagal modulation due to a significant decrease of nocturnal parasympathetic activity. The significant gender-related difference of HRV decreases with aging. These findings emphasize the need to determine age-, gender-, and nycthemeral-dependent normal ranges for HRV assessment.},

abstract = {Transient left ventricular dysfunction in patients under emotional stress, also known as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, has been recognized as a distinct clinical entity. Recent studies have supported the concept notion that the cardiovascular system is regulated by cortical modulation. A network consisting of the insular cortex (Ic), anterior cingulate gyrus, and amygdala plays a crucial role in the regulation of the central autonomic nervous system in relation to emotional stress such as anxiety, fear and sadness. Because the Ic is located in the region of the middle cerebral arteries, its structure tends to be exposed to a higher risk of cerebrovascular disease. Ic damage has been associated with myocardial injury, increased brain natriuretic peptide, and the incidence of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Because Ic damage has been associated with increased sympathetic nervous system activity, Ic damage is suggested to have a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. In this review, we focus on the role of the Ic as a mediator for the cardiovascular system in relation to emotional stress, and we summarizes the current knowledge on the relationships between the Ic and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.},

abstract = {In the present paper we present the outlines of a model that integrates autonomic, attentional, and affective systems into a functional and structural network that may help to guide us in our understanding of emotion regulation and dysregulation. We will emphasize the relationship between attentional regulation and affective processes and propose a group of underlying physiological systems that serve to integrate these functions in the service of self-regulation and adaptability of the organism. We will attempt to place this network in the context of dynamical systems models which involve feedback and feedforward circuits with special attention to negative feedback mechanisms, inhibitory processes, and their role in response selection. From a systems perspective, inhibitory processes can be viewed as negative feedback circuits that allow for the interruption of ongoing behavior and the re-deployment of resources to other tasks. When these negative feedback mechanisms are compromised, positive feedback loops may develop as a result (of dis-inhibition). From this perspective, the relative sympathetic activation seen in anxiety disorders may represent dis-inhibition due to faulty inhibitory mechanisms. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Autonomic imbalances including parasympathetic withdrawal and sympathetic overactivity are cardinal features of heart failure regardless of etiology; however, mechanisms underlying these imbalances remain unknown. Animal model studies of heart and visceral organ hypertrophy predict that nerve growth factor levels should be elevated in heart failure; whether this is so in human heart failure, though, remains unclear. We tested the hypotheses that neurons in cardiac ganglia are hypertrophied in human, canine, and rat heart failure and that nerve growth factor, which we hypothesize is elevated in the failing heart, contributes to this neuronal hypertrophy. Somal morphology of neurons from human (579.54±14.34 versus 327.45±9.17 $\mu$m(2); P<0.01) and canine hearts (767.80±18.37 versus 650.23±9.84 $\mu$m(2); P<0.01) failing secondary to ischemia and neurons from spontaneously hypertensive rat hearts (327.98±3.15 versus 271.29±2.79 $\mu$m(2); P<0.01) failing secondary to hypertension reveal significant hypertrophy of neurons in cardiac ganglia compared with controls. Western blot analysis shows that nerve growth factor levels in the explanted, failing human heart are 250% greater than levels in healthy donor hearts. Neurons from cardiac ganglia cultured with nerve growth factor are significantly larger and have greater dendritic arborization than neurons in control cultures. Hypertrophied neurons are significantly less excitable than smaller ones; thus, hypertrophy of vagal postganglionic neurons in cardiac ganglia would help to explain the parasympathetic withdrawal that accompanies heart failure. Furthermore, our observations suggest that nerve growth factor, which is elevated in the failing human heart, causes hypertrophy of neurons in cardiac ganglia.},

abstract = {There is robust medical evidence supporting the use of RMPI for the diagnostic evaluation and risk assessment of symptomatic patients with known or suspected ischemic heart disease. Yet, in general, similar literature is not available for asymptomatic individuals. However, the underlying physiologic assessment of coronary blood flow and its potential to impact on patient management should be similar. Clinical risk assessment is key with regards to applying RMPI for the evaluation of asymptomatic individuals, although the exact method of risk determination remains unclear. In many settings, a tiered approach to clinical evaluation is warranted, with risk determination and possibly other testing such as calcium scoring preceding the performance of RMPI. High-risk patients (i.e., >20% CHD risk for MI or death within 10 years) constitute a cohort where RMPI would be appropriate. Beyond the determination of overall clinical risk, certain subgroups of asymptomatic patients warrant special attention and consideration for RMPI, such as those with a family history of premature CHD. CAD risk equivalents, such as peripheral vascular disease, ED and impaired functional capacity may benefit from RMPI testing, but there little to no supportive data to sustain a recommendation. The data to date for the use of RMPI in diabetics appears to discourage its use in asymptomatic patients, but it appears to be reasonable to consider RMPI for high-risk diabetics, including older individuals and those with an abnormal ECG or an elevated calcium score. There are data, albeit inconclusive, to suggest the use of RMPI in asymptomatic CKD patients, although information about comparative or cost-effectiveness is lacking. Currently, the use of RMPI for HIV patients or those with autoimmune diseases cannot be recommended. Regarding the cohort of patients undergoing pre-operative evaluation, RMPI should be ordered primarily based on the risk of the surgical procedure (i.e., intermediate to high) and the presence of at least one risk factor. Often, prior testing may lead to the performance of RMPI. However, there is no indication at the current time for RMPI based solely on the presence of an abnormal carotid intima-media thickness or a patient with LV dysfunction. However, an elevated calcium score may provide an appropriate reason to consider RMPI, especially in high CHD risk patients. Finally, RMPI should not be routinely repeated within 2 years of a prior study in the absence of symptoms. For patients with known disease, there are inferential data supporting the use of RMPI, but no strong recommendation may be offered. After an acute coronary syndrome, testing has been shown to allow for optimization of therapy and may play an important role in management. However, there is no value in performing RMPI in asymptomatic patients within 2 years of PCI or within 5 years of CABG. Future research is indicated to further delineate the optimal use of RMPI in asymptomatic individuals, especially those with a strong family history of CAD and those with other tests suggesting a high-risk cohort, such as diabetic patients with an elevated calcium score. These trials must also closely examine the potential impact of therapeutic intervention on patient outcomes, as well as cost-effectiveness.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is evident in only half of patients referred for diagnostic angiography. Five-minute heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive marker for autonomic control of the vasculature, which this study hypothesised could risk-stratify cardiac patients and reduce unnecessary angiograms.\n\nDESIGN: A prospective observational study (the Alternative Risk Markers in Coronary Artery Disease (ARM-CAD) study).\n\nSETTING: Three cardiac centres in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nPATIENTS: 470 consecutive patients undergoing elective angiography (with predominantly normal cardiac rhythm), regardless of co-morbidity.\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The presence of obstructive CAD (≥50% stenosis) on angiography.\n\nRESULTS: Patients with obstructive CAD had significantly reduced HRV, particularly in the low frequency (LF) range (median 180 vs 267 ms(2) without CAD; p<0.001). There was a linear trend with the severity of CAD; median LF power (IQR) in patients with normal coronaries was 275 (612), with minor coronary irregularities 255 (400), single-vessel CAD 212 (396) and more severe disease 170 (327) ms(2); p value for trend 0.003. There was a similar reduction in LF power regardless of the anatomical location of coronary stenoses. Comparing patients with LF less than 250 and 250 ms(2) or greater, the adjusted OR for obstructive CAD using multivariate regression was 2.42, 95% CI 1.33 to 4.38 (p=0.004). No interactions were noted in subgroup analysis and HRV added to risk prediction irrespective of the baseline Framingham risk (p<0.0001).\n\nCONCLUSION: Low HRV is strongly predictive of angiographic coronary disease regardless of other co-morbidities and is clinically useful as a risk predictor in patients with sinus rhythm.\n\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION INFORMATION: http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00403351 www.armcad.com.},

abstract = {The circadian variations of spectral indices of heart rate variability were analyzed in 20 patients 4 weeks after a first and uncomplicated myocardial infarction (MI) and in 20 control subjects. R-R interval and variance showed a characteristic day-night pattern with a significant reduction of the latter parameter in patients after MI (10967 ± 1109 msec2vs 16860 ± 2132 msec2). Control subjects were characterized by a predominance of low-frequency (∼0.1 Hz) component during the day and of high-frequency (∼0.25 Hz) component during the night, which reflected the expected 24-hour pattern of variation of sympathovagal balance. A 24-hour elevation (64 ± 3 normalized units [nu] vs 56 ± 2 nu; p < 0.05) of the low-frequency component and a smaller (23 ± 2 nu vs 32 ± 2 nu; p < 0.05) high-frequency component during the night differentiated patients after MI from subjects. The difference between the two groups was even more evident when the 24-hour sympathovagal balance was assessed with the low frequency/high frequency ratio. Thus spectral analysis of heart rate variability indicates that in patients after MI there is an alteration of neural control mechanisms as indicated by the presence of signs of sympathetic activation and by the attenuation of the nocturnal increase in vagal tone. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {Objectives Young women have poorer prognosis after myocardial infarction (MI) and a higher rate of mental stress-induced ischemia compared with similarly aged men. A higher inflammatory status may help explain these sex differences. Methods We examined 98 patients (49 women and 49 men) age 18–59 years with recent MI (past 6 months). Women and men were matched for age, type of MI, and time since MI. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) concentrations were measured at baseline, after mental stress using a speech task, and after exercise/pharmacologic stress (60 and 90 min). Depressive symptoms were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and angiographic coronary artery disease (CAD) severity was quantified with the Gensini score. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was used to obtain a computerized measurement of stress-induced ischemia (summed difference score, or SDS) and determine whether severity of stress-induced ischemia affects the inflammatory response to stress. Analysis was stratified by the median age of 50. Geometric mean concentrations of IL-6 were obtained from general linear regression models. Results In both age groups, women had less angiographic CAD and a similar level of conventional risk factors compared with men. Despite this, baseline IL-6 geometric means before both mental and physical stress were twice as high in women ⩽50 years of age compared to age-matched men (3.8 vs. 1.8 pg/mL, p = 0.001, across both conditions), while they were similar in women and men age >50 years (2.3 vs. 2.2 pg/mL, p = 0.83). After mental stress, IL-6 concentrations increased in both women and men in a similar fashion and remained twice as high in women ⩽50 years than men at both 60 min (5.4 vs. 2.6 pg/mL, p = 0.002) and 90 min (5.9 vs. 3.4 pg/mL, p = 0.01). No significant difference was found between women and men?>50 years of age at any time point after mental stress. Results were similar for physical stress. After accounting for SDS, IL-6 concentrations in young women remained higher after both mental and physical stress. Baseline IL-6 concentrations were not significantly related to inducible ischemia. Conclusions After MI, young women aged 50 years or younger, compared with age-matched men, have remarkably higher concentrations of inflammation at baseline and after both mental and physical stress, with a similar inflammatory response to both stressors. Sustained concentrations of inflammation in young women, not their response to stress, may contribute to their adverse outcomes post-MI.},

abstract = {he vagus and sympathetic nerves link the heart to the central nervous system, carrying information from the heart over neural afferents and to the heart over neural efferents. Although it is generally well accepted that the autonomic nervous system can promote, precipitate, or prevent the development of cardiac arrhythmias, the mechanisms by which this transpires are incompletely understood. Several excellent recent reviews provide an overall discussion of the role of the autonomic nervous system and the genesis of cardiac arrhythmias.12 This review will focus on selected recent observations concerning autonomic innervation of the heart, the effects of myocardial ischemia and infarction on such innervation, and how some of these changes can modulate the development of cardiac arrhythmias. Autonomic Innervation of Heart Extracardiac Nerves Numerous studies to determine extracardiac neu-ral innervation to the heart reveal that although significant overlap and complex patterns exist, in general autonomic neural input to the heart exhibits some degree of "sidedness." The right sympathetic and vagus nerves affect the sinus node more than the atrioventricular (AV) node, whereas the left sympathetic and vagus nerves affect the AV node more than the sinus node. Precise points of entry of parasympathetic nerves to the sinus and AV nodal regions have recently been described.3 On the right, vagal input to the superior atrial and sinus nodal regions is by neural projections along the superior vena cava-right atrial junction, azygos vein, right pulmonary vein complex, and dorsal surfaces of the common pulmonary vein complex. On the left, vagal input to the sinus nodal region is quantitatively less,},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to investigate associations between psychosocial risk factors, including social isolation, anger and depressive symptoms, and heart rate variability in healthy women. METHODS: The study group consisted of 300 healthy women (median age 57.5 years) who were representative of women living in the greater Stockholm area. For the measurement of social isolation, a condensed version of the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List was used and household size assessed. Anger was measured by the anger scales previously used in the Framingham study and depressive symptoms by a questionnaire derived from Pearlin. Health behaviors were measured by means of standard questionnaires. From 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, both time and frequency domain measures were obtained: SDNN index (mean of the SDs of all normal to normal intervals for all 5-minute segments of the entire recording), VLF power (very low frequency power), LF power (low frequency power), HF power (high frequency power), and the LF/HF ratio (low frequency by high frequency ratio) were computed. RESULTS: Social isolation and inability to relieve anger by talking to others were associated with decreased heart rate variability. Depressive symptoms were related only to the LF/HF ratio. Adjusting for age, menopausal status, exercise and smoking habits, history of hypertension, and BMI did not substantially change the results. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest heart rate variability to be a mediating mechanism that could explain at least part of the reported associations between social isolation, suppressed anger, and health outcomes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Intensive therapy targeting normal blood glucose increased mortality compared with standard treatment in a randomized clinical trial of 10,251 participants with type 2 diabetes at high-risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. We evaluated whether the presence of cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) at baseline modified the effect of intensive compared with standard glycemia treatment on mortality outcomes in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial participants.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: CAN was assessed by measures of heart rate variability (HRV) and QT index (QTI) computed from 10-s resting electrocardiograms in 8,135 ACCORD trial participants with valid measurements (mean age 63.0 years, 40% women). Prespecified CAN definitions included a composite of the lowest quartile of HRV and highest QTI quartile in the presence or absence of peripheral neuropathy. Outcomes were all-cause and CVD mortality. Associations between CAN and mortality were evaluated by proportional hazards analysis, adjusting for treatment group allocation, CVD history, and multiple prespecified baseline covariates.\nRESULTS: During a mean 3.5 years follow-up, there were 329 deaths from all causes. In fully adjusted analyses, participants with baseline CAN were 1.55-2.14 times as likely to die as participants without CAN, depending on the CAN definition used (P < 0.02 for all). The effect of allocation to the intensive group on all-cause and CVD mortality was similar in participants with or without CAN at baseline (P(interaction) > 0.7).\nCONCLUSIONS: Whereas CAN was associated with increased mortality in this high-risk type 2 diabetes cohort, these analyses indicate that participants with CAN at baseline had similar mortality outcomes from intensive compared with standard glycemia treatment in the ACCORD cohort.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability biofeedback (HRV-BFB) has been shown as useful tool to manage stress in various populations. The present study was designed to investigate whether the biofeedback-based stress management tool consisting of rhythmic breathing, actively self-generated positive emotions and a portable biofeedback device induce changes in athletes' HRV, EEG patterns, and self-reported anxiety and self-esteem. The study involved 41 healthy male athletes, aged 16-21 (mean 18.34 +/- 1.36) years. Participants were randomly divided into two groups: biofeedback and control. Athletes in the biofeedback group received HRV biofeedback training, athletes in the control group didn't receive any intervention. During the randomized controlled trial (days 0-21), the mean anxiety score declined significantly for the intervention group (change-4 p < 0.001) but not for the control group (p = 0.817). In addition, as compared to the control, athletes in biofeedback group showed substantial and statistically significant improvement in heart rate variability indices and changes in power spectra of both theta and alpha brain waves, and alpha asymmetry. These changes suggest better self-control in the central nervous system and better flexibility of the autonomic nervous system in the group that received biofeedback training. A HRV biofeedback-based stress management tool may be beneficial for stress reduction for young male athletes.},

abstract = {Background��� Blacks have disproportionately high rates of cardiovascular disease. Psychosocial stress may contribute to this disparity. Previous trials on stress reduction with the Transcendental Meditation (TM) program have reported improvements in cardiovascular disease risk factors, surrogate end points, and mortality in blacks and other populations. Methods and Results��� This was a randomized, controlled trial of 201 black men and women with coronary heart disease who were randomized to the TM program or health education. The primary end point was the composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Secondary end points included the composite of cardiovascular mortality, revascularizations, and cardiovascular hospitalizations; blood pressure; psychosocial stress factors; and lifestyle behaviors. During an average follow-up of 5.4 years, there was a 48% risk reduction in the primary end point in the TM group (hazard ratio, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.29���0.92; P =0.025). The TM group also showed a 24% risk reduction in the secondary end point (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.51���0.1.13; P =0.17). There were reductions of 4.9 mmHg in systolic blood pressure (95% confidence interval ���8.3 to ���1.5 mmHg; P =0.01) and anger expression ( P <0.05 for all scales). Adherence was associated with survival. Conclusions��� A selected mind���body intervention, the TM program, significantly reduced risk for mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke in coronary heart disease patients. These changes were associated with lower blood pressure and psychosocial stress factors. Therefore, this practice may be clinically useful in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Depression is associated with increased risk of death among patients with coronary disease. Cardiovascular autonomic dysregulation may be one of the mechanisms by which depression exerts its effects on cardiovascular function. The purpose of this study was to determine whether depressive symptoms are associated with low heart rate variability (HRV) and prolonged HR recovery after exercise testing in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: The Psychophysiological Investigation of Myocardial Ischemia (PIMI) was a large, multicenter study designed to assess psychological and physiological correlates of stress in patients with CAD. One hundred and eighty-eight patients with CAD as evidenced by at least 50% blockage of one major artery and a previous positive exercise stress test were included in this study. Patients included in this report were not taking beta blockers. Cardiovascular functioning was assessed by a modified Bruce protocol treadmill stress test. Measures of psychological functioning, including the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), were also obtained. RESULTS: BDI scores were negatively correlated with HR recovery (r = -0.15, p = .04). Depression scores accounted for 3.5% of the variance in HR recovery when controlling for participant age (p < .01). Depressive symptoms were related to two HRV indices (ultra-low frequency, high frequency). CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms are associated with cardiovascular autonomic nervous system dysfunction as assessed by HR recovery. This relationship is not merely due to an association of depression severity with beta blocker usage or a failure of depressed patients to achieve an adequate chronotropic response.},

abstract = {In this paper the experimental evidence supporting the hypothesis that excitatory sympathetic reflexes may participate in the tonic control of the cardiovascular system is discussed. Positive feedback pressor sympathetic reflexes can be obtained with physiological distensions of the descending thoracic aorta in conscious dogs with all nerves intact in absence of any pain reaction. These excitatory reflexes interact with supraspinal regulatory mechanisms, inhibitory in nature. A massive excitation of cardiac sympathetic afferents, produced by intracoronary injections of bradykinin, also elicits a pressor reflex, without pain reactions. In the absence of anesthesia and recent surgery, the cardiovascular excitatory reflexes, subserved by sympathetic afferent fibers, can easily prevail. We suggest that negative and positive feedback mechanisms interact continuously to achieve the most adequate neural cardiovascular control.},

abstract = {Sporadic or late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) is expected to affect 50% of individuals reaching 85 years of age. The most significant genetic risk factor for late-onset AD is the e4 allele of APOE gene encoding apolipoprotein E, a lipid carrier shown to modulate brain amyloid burden. Recent genome-wide association studies have uncovered additional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to AD susceptibility, including those in the CLU and BIN1 genes encoding for clusterin (CLU) and the bridging integrator 1 (BIN1) proteins, respectively. Because CLU has been implicated in brain amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) clearance in mouse models of amyloid deposition, we sought to investigate whether an AD-linked SNP in the CLU gene altered A$\beta$42 biomarker levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Instead, we found that the CLU rs11136000 SNP modified CSF levels of the microtubule-associated protein Tau in AD patients. We also found that an intracellular form of CLU (iCLU) was upregulated in the brain of Tau overexpressing Tg4510 mice, but not in Tg2576 amyloid mouse model. By overexpressing iCLU and Tau in cell culture systems we discovered that iCLU was a Tau-interacting protein and that iCLU associated with brain-specific isoforms of BIN1, also recently identified as a Tau-binding protein. Through expression analysis of CLU and BIN1 variants, we found that CLU and BIN1 interacted via their coiled-coil motifs. In co-immunoprecipitation studies using human brain tissue, we showed that iCLU and the major BIN1 isoform expressed in neurons were associated with modified Tau species found in AD. Finally, we showed that expression of certain coding CLU variants linked to AD risk led to increased levels of iCLU. Together, our findings suggest that iCLU and BIN1 interaction might impact Tau function in neurons and uncover potential new mechanisms underlying the etiology of Tau pathology in AD.},

abstract = {In this study, we evaluated cardiovascular. neuroendocrine, and psychological adjustment to repeated presentations of a public speaking and a mental arithmetic task. Brief versions of mental arithmetic tasks have been used widely in previous reactivity studies, and growing attention to more socially salient tasks has led to the increased use of public speaking tasks. However, psychophysiological adjustment during extended and repeated exposure to these tasks has not been delineated. In the present study, 52 healthy men worked on three 8-min presentations of public speaking and of mental arithmetic in a repeated measure design. Both tasks produced substantial cardiovascular, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and cortisol responses; public speaking produced greater changes. Repeated presentations of public speaking produced a stable pattern of cardiac activation, whereas repetitions of the mental arithmetic initially produced large cardiac responses that changed to a more vascular tonus across task periods. Both tasks increased negative moods. However, correlations between the endocrine, cardiovascular, and negative moods were significant only during the public speaking stressor. The public speaking task is a socially relevant experimental protocol for studying reactivity in the laboratory setting and elicits relatively high, stable, and homogeneous responses.},

Three 10-second and 2 six-minute heart rate recordings were obtained during each of 2 visits, separated by 1 to 2 weeks. We partitioned the measurement error into components and computed intraclass correlation coefficients using nested, random effects models. Repeatability improved with the length of recording: intraclass correlation coefficients were greater than 0.7 for 6-minute measures and 2-minute time domain measures and greater than 0.5 for 2-minute frequency domain measures. Repeatability of measures from 10-second records was lower, but improved considerably when the mean from 2 or 3 records was used. Correlations between the same measures from different length recordings were quite high. Our findings support the use of records of at least 5 minutes in length in epidemiological studies, in accordance with previous guidelines. Researchers using 10-second records should consider taking the mean of several recordings, when possible, or using statistical methods to correct for measurement error.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Measures of baroreflex sensitivity, heart rate variability (HRV), and the classical Ewing test parameters are currently used for the diagnosis of diabetic autonomic neuropathy and for mortality risk stratification after myocardial infarction. However, the strengths of the associations of these measures of autonomic function with risk of mortality have never been compared in one study population. Furthermore, no evidence is available on the possible effect of glucose tolerance on these associations. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study population (n = 605) consisted of a glucose tolerance-stratified sample from a general population (50-75 years of age). Cardiac cycle duration and continuous finger arterial pressure were measured under two conditions: at rest and on metronome breathing. From these readings, seven parameters of autonomic function were assessed (one Ewing, five HRV, and one baroreflex sensitivity). RESULTS: During 9 years of follow-up, 101 individuals died, 43 from cardiovascular causes. Subjects with diabetes and low levels of the autonomic function parameters, indicating impaired autonomic function, had an approximately doubled risk of mortality. This association was consistent, though not statistically significant, for all parameters. The elevated risk was not observed in subjects without diabetes, hypertension, or prevalent cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired autonomic function is associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Moreover, the results of the present study suggest that cardiac autonomic dysfunction in patients already at risk (diabetes, hypertension, or history of cardiovascular disease) may be especially hazardous.},

abstract = {Objective: Silent myocardial ischemia is common in asymptomatic subjects without a prior history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Our objective was to determine whether endothelial dysfunction is associated with silent myocardial ischemia and whether the association is independent of genetic and familial factors.Material and methods: We examined 416 male monozygotic and dizygotic twins aged 47 to 63. years, free of symptomatic CAD. Subclinical ischemia was diagnosed by [13N] ammonia positron emission tomography at rest and after adenosine stress. Endothelial function was measured by flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery. Generalized estimating equations were used for analysis.Results: Fixed perfusion defects were found in 24 (6%) twins and reversible perfusion defects in 90 (22%) twins, indicating subclinical ischemia. There was an inverse correlation between FMD and the reversible perfusion defect score (r. =. -. 0.14, p. =. 0.01) but not the fixed defect score (r. =. -. 0.017, p. =. 0.73). From the lowest to the highest quartiles of FMD, the prevalence of reversible defects decreased from 28% to 14%, p. =. 0.008. In multivariable analysis, reversible defects were significantly associated with each quartile of decreasing FMD (OR. =. 1.3; 95% 1.1, 2.5). In 54 twin pairs discordant for endothelial dysfunction (FMD. ≤. 7% dilation from baseline), twins with endothelial dysfunction had 9% higher likelihood of having perfusion defects than their co-twins without endothelial dysfunction (p. =. 0.041).Conclusions: Endothelial dysfunction is independently associated with silent ischemia and this association is not confounded by genetic or other shared familial factors.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED In patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), mental stress may provoke ischemic electrocardiograph changes and abnormalities in regional and global left ventricular function. However, little is known about the underlying myocardial blood flow response (MBF) in these patients. METHODS We investigated the hemodynamic, neurohumoral, and myocardial blood flow responses to mental stress in 17 patients with CAD and 17 healthy volunteers of similar age. Mental stress was induced by asking individuals to solve mathematic subtractions in a progressively challenging sequence; MBF was quantified at rest and during mental stress using 13N ammonia PET. RESULTS Mental stress induced significant (P < 0.01) and comparable increases in rate-pressure product, measured in beats per minute x mm Hg, in both patients (from 7826 +/- 2006 to 10586 +/- 2800) and healthy volunteers (from 8227 +/- 1272 to 10618 +/- 2468). Comparable increases also occurred in serum epinephrine (58% in patients versus 52% in healthy volunteers) and norepinephrine (22% in patients versus 27% in healthy volunteers). Although MBF increased in patients (from 0.67 +/- 0.15 to 0.77 +/- 0.18 mL/min/g, P < 0.05) and healthy volunteers (from 0.73 +/- 0.13 to 0.95 +/- 0.22 mL/min/g, P < 0.001), the magnitude of flow increase was smaller in patients (14% +/- 17%) than in healthy volunteers (29% +/- 14%) (P = 0.01). The increase in MBF during mental stress correlated significantly with changes in cardiac work in healthy volunteers (r = 0.77; P < 0.001) but not in patients. CONCLUSION Despite similar increases in cardiac work and comparable sympathetic stimulation in CAD patients and healthy volunteers, CAD patients exhibit an attenuated blood flow response to mental stress that may contribute to mental stress-induced ischemic episodes in daily life.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Physiological Society.Cardiac control is mediated via a series of reflex control networks involving somata in the (i) intrinsic cardiac ganglia (heart), (ii) intrathoracic extracardiac ganglia (stellate, middle cervical), (iii) superior cervical ganglia, (iv) spinal cord, (v) brainstem, and (vi) higher centers. Each of these processing centers contains afferent, efferent, and local circuit neurons, which interact locally and in an interdependent fashion with the other levels to coordinate regional cardiac electrical and mechanical indices on a beat-to-beat basis. This control system is optimized to respond to normal physiological stressors (standing, exercise, and temperature); however, it can be catastrophically disrupted by pathological events such as myocardial ischemia. In fact, it is now recognized that autonomic dysregulation is central to the evolution of heart failure and arrhythmias. Autonomic regulation therapy is an emerging modality in the management of acute and chronic cardiac pathologies. Neuromodulation-based approaches that target select nexus points of this hierarchy for cardiac control offer unique opportunities to positively affect therapeutic outcomes via improved efficacy of cardiovascular reflex control. As such, understanding the anatomical and physiological basis for such control is necessary to implement effectively novel neuromodulation therapies},

abstract = {Background: Acute coronary syndromes (ACS; myocardial infarction or unstable angina) can induce posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and ACS-induced PTSD may increase patients' risk for subsequent cardiac events and mortality. Objective: To determine the prevalence of PTSD induced by ACS and to quantify the association between ACS-induced PTSD and adverse clinical outcomes using systematic review and meta-analysis. Data Sources: Articles were identified by searching Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Scopus, and through manual search of reference lists. Methodology/Principal Findings: Observational cohort studies that assessed PTSD with specific reference to an ACS event at least 1 month prior. We extracted estimates of the prevalence of ACS-induced PTSD and associations with clinical outcomes, as well as study characteristics. We identified 56 potentially relevant articles, 24 of which met our criteria (N = 2383). Meta-analysis yielded an aggregated prevalence estimate of 12% (95% confidence interval [CI], 9%–16%) for clinically significant symptoms of ACS-induced PTSD in a random effects model. Individual study prevalence estimates varied widely (0%–32%), with significant heterogeneity in estimates explained by the use of a screening instrument (prevalence estimate was 16% [95% CI, 13%–20%] in 16 studies) vs a clinical diagnostic interview (prevalence estimate was 4% [95% CI, 3%–5%] in 8 studies). The aggregated point estimate for the magnitude of the relationship between ACS-induced PTSD and clinical outcomes (ie, mortality and/or ACS recurrence) across the 3 studies that met our criteria (N = 609) suggested a doubling of risk (risk ratio, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.69–2.37) in ACS patients with clinically significant PTSD symptoms relative to patients without PTSD symptoms. Conclusions/Significance: This meta-analysis suggests that clinically significant PTSD symptoms induced by ACS are moderately prevalent and are associated with increased risk for recurrent cardiac events and mortality. Further tests of the association of ACS-induced PTSD and clinical outcomes are needed.},

abstract = {We recently reported that the vagal cardiopulmonary baroreceptor reflex inhibition of renal nerve traffic is impaired in rabbits with renal hypertension. The purpose of this study was to determine if the locus of the abnormality is mainly in the brain or in the afferent limb of the reflex. Experiments were done in alpha-chloralose-anesthetized rabbits with (n = 10) or without (n = 10) hypertension induced 6 to 8 weeks before study by wrapping the left kidney in cellophane followed by removal of the right kidney. The left side of the chest was opened, and a pericardial cradle was made. Nicotine was applied to the epicardial surface of the heart in concentrations of 10 to 500 micrograms/ml, and changes in arterial pressure and renal nerve traffic were measured. Dose-dependent decreases in traffic and arterial pressure resulted that were significantly smaller in hypertensive than in normotensive rabbits. After sinoaortic baroreceptor denervation, a similar impairment in the responses of hypertensive rabbits was observed. Vagotomy nearly abolished the responses of the renal nerves to epicardial nicotine. The responses of the lumbar sympathetic nerves to epicardial nicotine also were impaired in renal hypertensive (n = 8) compared with normotensive rabbits (n = 8). If the behavior and number of chemically sensitive endings are assumed to be unaltered in hypertension, then these findings are explained best by an abnormality in the central nervous system. These results support the view that the previously reported impairment in the vagal cardiopulmonary baroreceptor reflex control of renal nerve traffic is due mainly to a central abnormality, although they do not exclude an abnormality in the afferent limb of the reflex.},

The integrated baroreflex gain and its mechanical and neural component were estimated and then related to the blood pressure and heart rate responses to simulated real-life stressors: mental arithmetic and public speaking. Eighteen healthy individuals (aged 61 8 yr) and 29 individuals with documented CAD but no other comorbidities (aged 59 8 yr) were studied. Heart rate and blood pressures were continuously assessed before, during preparation for, and during performance of a math task and a speech task. The assessment of beat-to-beat carotid diameters during baroreflex engagement was used to estimate the integrated baroreflex gain and its mechanical and neural component. The CAD subjects demonstrated significantly greater increases in heart rate and blood pressures for the performance of the speech task. However, there were no group differences in integrated cardiovagal baroreflex gain or either mechanical or neural baroreflex component. These findings indicate that the augmented pressor responses in CAD do not result from a generalized arterial baroreflex deficit.},

In this study, we evaluated accuracy of two PPG based (wrist i.e. Mio Alpha vs forearm i.e. Schosche Rhythm) commercially available HR monitors during exercise. 21 healthy volunteers (15 male and 6 female) completed an exercise protocol which included sitting, lying, walking, running, cycling, and some daily activities involving hand movements. HR estimation was compared against values from the reference electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. The heart rate estimation reliability scores for <5% accuracy against reference were following: mio Alpha 77,83% and Scosche Rhytm 76,29%. The estimated results indicate that performance of devices depends on various parameters, including specified activity, sensor type and device placement.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction appears in the course of both chronic heart failure (CHF) and depression. Comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation (CCR), apart from improving physical capacity, can reduce depressive symptoms and leads to the restoration of ANS function among CHF patients. The purpose was to evaluate the influence of the reversion of depression (measured by Beck Depression Inventory [BDI] score, cut point <10) and the physical capacity improvement (measured by peak oxygen consumption [peak VO2 ; ml/kg per minute]) on the sympathovagal balance (measured by low/high frequency ratio [LF/HF]) after CCR in CHF patients. METHODS: The study group comprised 111 CHF patients (New York Heart Association II-III; left ventricular ejection fraction </= 40%). Patients were randomized (2:1) to 8-week CCR based on Nordic walking training (five times weekly) at 40-70% of maximal heart rate, training group (TG) n = 77, or to control group (CG) n = 34. The effectiveness of CCR was assessed by changes-delta (Delta) in LF/HF, BDI score, and peak VO2 , as a result of comparing these parameters from the beginning and the end of the program. RESULTS: Eventually, 46 patients in TG and 23 patients in CG were eligible for simultaneous ANS and psychological status analysis. Only in TG the LF/HF decreased 2.06 +/- 1.14 versus 1.19 +/- 0.80 (P < 0.0001) and peak VO2 increased 16.83 +/- 3.72 versus 19.14 +/- 4.20 ml/kg per minute (P < 0.0001). Favorable results in CG were not observed. The differences between TG and CG were significant: Deltapeak VO2 (P < 0.0001); DeltaLF/HF (P = 0.0001). Depressive symptoms were substantially reduced in both groups (TG, P = 0.0006; CG, P = 0.0490). Nevertheless, the greatest improvement of sympathovagal balance was observed in patients whose depression was reversed, thanks to the CCR in comparison to other patients from TG and the entire CG. CONCLUSION: Positive effect of the sympatho-parasympathetic balance obtained during the home CCR based on Nordic walking training results from the additive effects of the reversion of depression and physical capacity improvement in CHF patients.},

abstract = {Diurnal rhythms influence cardiovascular physiology, i.e. heart rate and blood pressure, and they appear to also modulate the incidence of serious adverse cardiac events. Diurnal variations occur also at the molecular level including changes in gene expression in the heart and blood vessels. Moreover, the risk/benefit ratio of some therapeutic strategies and the concentration of circulating cardiovascular system biomarkers may also vary across the 24-hr light/dark cycle. Synchrony between external and internal diurnal rhythms and harmony among molecular rhythms within the cell are essential for normal organ biology. Diurnal variations in the responsiveness of the cardiovascular system to environmental stimuli are mediated by a complex interplay between extracellular (i.e. neurohumoral factors) and intracellular (i.e. specific genes that are differentially light/dark regulated) mechanisms. Neurohormones, which are particularly relevant to the cardiovascular system, such as melatonin, exhibit a diurnal variation and may play a role in the synchronization of molecular circadian clocks in the peripheral tissue and the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Moreover, mounting evidence reveals that the blood melatonin rhythm has a crucial role in several cardiovascular functions, including daily variations in blood pressure. Melatonin has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, chronobiotic and, possibly, epigenetic regulatory functions. This article reviews current knowledge related to the biological role of melatonin and its circadian rhythm in cardiovascular disease.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To investigate sex-specific vascular mechanisms for mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI). APPROACH AND RESULTS Baseline data from a prospective cohort study of 678 patients with coronary artery disease underwent myocardial perfusion imaging before and during a public speaking stressor. The rate-pressure product response was calculated as the difference between the maximum value during the speech minus the minimum value during rest. Peripheral vasoconstriction by peripheral arterial tonometry was calculated as the ratio of pulse wave amplitude during the speech over the resting baseline; ratios <1 indicate a vasoconstrictive response. MSIMI was defined as percent of left ventricle that was ischemic and as a dichotomous variable. Men (but not women) with MSIMI had a higher rate-pressure product response than those without MSIMI (6500 versus 4800 mm Hg bpm), whereas women (but not men) with MSIMI had a significantly lower peripheral arterial tonometry ratio than those without MSIMI (0.5 versus 0.8). In adjusted linear regression, each 1000-U increase in rate-pressure product response was associated with 0.32% (95% confidence interval, 0.22-0.42) increase in inducible ischemia among men, whereas each 0.10-U decrease in peripheral arterial tonometry ratio was associated with 0.23% (95% confidence interval, 0.11-0.35) increase in inducible myocardial ischemia among women. Results were independent of conventional stress-induced myocardial ischemia. CONCLUSIONS Women and men have distinct cardiovascular reactivity mechanisms for MSIMI. For women, stress-induced peripheral vasoconstriction with mental stress, and not increased hemodynamic workload, is associated with MSIMI, whereas for men, it is the opposite. Future studies should examine these pathways on long-term outcomes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Power spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) has been used to indicate cardiac autonomic function. High-frequency power relates to respiratory sinus arrhythmia and therefore to parasympathetic cardiovagal tone; however, the relationship of low-frequency (LF) power to cardiac sympathetic innervation and function has been controversial. Alternatively, LF power might reflect baroreflexive modulation of autonomic outflows.\n\nOBJECTIVE: We studied normal volunteers and chronic autonomic failure syndrome patients with and without loss of cardiac noradrenergic nerves to examine the relationships of LF power with cardiac sympathetic innervation and baroreflex function.\n\nMETHODS: We compared LF power of HRV in patients with cardiac sympathetic denervation, as indicated by low myocardial concentrations of 6-[(18)F] fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity or low rates of norepinephrine entry into coronary sinus plasma (cardiac norepinephrine spillover) to values in patients with intact innervation, at baseline, during infusion of yohimbine, which increases exocytotic norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerves, or during infusion of tyramine, which increases non-exocytotic release. Baroreflex-cardiovagal slope (BRS) was calculated from the cardiac interbeat interval and systolic pressure during the Valsalva maneuver.\n\nRESULTS: LF power was unrelated to myocardial 6-[(18)F] fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity or cardiac norepinephrine spillover. In contrast, the log of LF power correlated positively with the log of BRS (r=0.72, P <0.0001). Patients with a low BRS (<or=3 msec/mm Hg) had low LF power, regardless of cardiac innervation. Tyramine and yohimbine increased LF power in subjects with normal BRS but not in those with low BRS. BRS at baseline predicted LF responses to tyramine and yohimbine.\n\nCONCLUSION: LF power reflects baroreflex function, not cardiac sympathetic innervation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The extent and locations of intrinsic cardiac ganglia on the human heart were investigated to facilitate studying their function. METHODS: The locations and number of major intrinsic cardiac ganglia were determined in six human hearts by means of microdissection following methylene blue staining. Light and electron microscopic analyses were performed on right atrial and cranial medial ventricular ganglia obtained from 12 other human hearts. RESULTS: Gross anatomy: Collections of ganglia associated with nerves, i.e., ganglionated plexuses, were observed consistently in five atrial and five ventricular regions. Occasional ganglia were located in other atrial and ventricular regions. Atrial ganglionated plexuses were identified on 1) the superior surface of the right atrium, 2) the superior surface of the left atrium, 3) the posterior surface of the right atrium, 4) the posterior medial surface of the left atrium (the latter two fuse medially where they extend anteriorly into the interatrial septum), and 5) the inferior and lateral aspect of the posterior left atrium. Ventricular ganglionated plexuses were located in fat 1) surrounding the aortic root, 2) at the origins of the right and left coronary arteries (the latter extending to the origins of the left anterior descending and circumflex coronary arteries), 3) at the origin of the posterior descending coronary artery, 4) adjacent to the origin of the right acute marginal coronary artery, and 5) at the origin of the left obtuse marginal coronary artery. Microscopic anatomy: Ganglia ranged in size from those containing a few neurons to large ganglia measuring up to 0.5 x 1 mm. The human heart is estimated to contain more than 14,000 neurons. Neuronal somata varied in size and shape. Many axon terminals in intrinsic cardiac ganglia contained large numbers of small, clear, round vesicles that formed asymmetrical axodendritic synapses, whereas a few axons contained large, dense-cored vesicles. CONCLUSIONS: The human intrinsic cardiac nervous system is distributed more extensively than was considered previously, most of its ganglia being located on the posterior surfaces of the atria and superior aspect of the ventricles. Each ganglion therein contains a variety of neurons that are associated with complex synaptology.},

A wide range of platforms exist to model and study disorders associated with sudden cardiac death. Human clinical studies are cumbersome and are thwarted by the extent of investigation that can be performed on human subjects. Animal models are limited by their degree of homology to human cardiac electrophysiology, including ion channel expression. Most commonly used cellular models are cellular transfection models, which are able to mimic the expression of a single-ion channel offering incomplete insight into changes of the action potential profile. Induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes resemble, but are not identical, adult human cardiomyocytes and provide a new platform for studying arrhythmic disorders leading to sudden cardiac death. A variety of platforms exist to phenotype cellular models, including conventional and automated patch clamp, multielectrode array, and computational modeling. Induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes have been used to study long QT syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and other hereditary cardiac disorders. Although induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes are distinct from adult cardiomyocytes, they provide a robust platform to advance the science and clinical care of sudden cardiac death.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Brain imaging studies in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have implicated a circuitry of brain regions including the medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, parietal cortex, and insula. Pharmacological treatment studies have shown a reversal of medial prefrontal deficits in response to traumatic reminders. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a promising non-pharmacologic approach to the treatment of anxiety and pain disorders. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of MBSR on PTSD symptoms and brain response to traumatic reminders measured with positron-emission tomography (PET) in Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) combat veterans with PTSD. We hypothesized that MBSR would show increased prefrontal response to stress and improved PTSD symptoms in veterans with PTSD. METHOD Twenty-six OEF/OIF combat veterans with PTSD who had recently returned from a combat zone were block randomized to receive eight sessions of MBSR or present-centered group therapy (PCGT). PTSD patients underwent assessment of PTSD symptoms with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), mindfulness with the Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) and brain imaging using PET in conjunction with exposure to neutral and Iraq combat-related slides and sound before and after treatment. Nine patients in the MBSR group and 8 in the PCGT group completed all study procedures. RESULTS Post-traumatic stress disorder patients treated with MBSR (but not PCGT) had an improvement in PTSD symptoms measured with the CAPS that persisted for 6 months after treatment. MBSR also resulted in an increase in mindfulness measured with the FFMQ. MBSR-treated patients had increased anterior cingulate and inferior parietal lobule and decreased insula and precuneus function in response to traumatic reminders compared to the PCGT group. CONCLUSION This study shows that MBSR is a safe and effective treatment for PTSD. Furthermore, MBSR treatment is associated with changes in brain regions that have been implicated in PTSD and are involved in extinction of fear responses to traumatic memories as well as regulation of the stress response.},

abstract = {The co-transmitter neuropeptide Y (NPY), released during prolonged cardiac sympathetic nerve stimulation, can attenuate vagal-induced bradycardia. We tested the hypothesis that NPY reduces acetylcholine release, at similar concentrations to which it attenuates vagal bradycardia, via pre-synaptic Y2 receptors modulating a pathway that is dependent on protein kinase A (PKA) or protein kinase C (PKC). The Y2 receptor was immunofluorescently colocalized with choline acetyl-transferase containing neurons at the guinea pig sinoatrial node. The effect of NPY in the presence of various enzyme inhibitors was then tested on the heart rate response to vagal nerve stimulation in isolated guinea pig sinoatrial node/right vagal nerve preparations and also on 3H-acetylcholine release from right atria during field stimulation. NPY reduced the heart rate response to vagal stimulation at 1, 3 and 5 Hz (significant at 100 nM and reaching a plateau at 250 nM NPY, p < 0.05, n = 6) but not to the stable analogue of acetylcholine, carbamylcholine (30, 60 or 90 nM, n = 6) which produced similar degrees of bradycardia. The reduced vagal response was abolished by the Y2 receptor antagonist BIIE 0246 (1 $\mu$M, n = 4). NPY also significantly attenuated the release of 3H-acetylcholine during field stimulation (250 nM, n = 6). The effect of NPY (250 nM) on vagal bradycardia was abolished by the PKC inhibitors calphostin C (0.1 $\mu$M, n = 5) and chelerythrine chloride (25 $\mu$M, n = 6) but not the PKA inhibitor H89 (0.5 $\mu$M, n = 6). Conversely, the PKC activator Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (0.5 $\mu$M, n = 7) mimicked the effect of NPY and significantly reduced 3H-acetylcholine release during field stimulation. These results show that NPY attenuates vagal bradycardia via a pre-synaptic decrease in acetylcholine release that appears to be mediated by a Y2 receptor pathway involving modulation of PKC. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Background. Experimental evidence suggests that autonomic markers such as heart-rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) may contribute to post-infarction risk stratification. There are clinical data to support this concept for heart-rate variability. The main objective of the ATRAMI study was to provide prospective data on the additional and independent prognostic value for cardiac mortality of heart-rate variability and BRS in patients after myocardial infarction in whom left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and ventricular arrhythmias were known. Methods. This multicentre international prospective study enrolled 1284 patients with a recent (< 28 days) myocardial infarction, 24 h Holter recording was done to quantify heart-rate variability (measured as standard deviation of normal to normal RR intervals [SDNN]) and ventricular arrhythmias. BRS was calculated from measurement of the rate-pressure response to intravenous phenylephrine. Findings. During 21 (SD 8) months of follow-up, the primary endpoint, cardiac mortality, included 44 cardiac deaths and five non-fatal cardiac arrests. Low values of either heart-rate variability (SDNN < 70 ms) or BRS (< 3.0 ms per mmHg) carried a significant multivariate risk of cardiac mortality (3.2 [95% CI 1.42-7.36] and 2.8 [1.24-6.16], respectively). The association of low SDNN and BRS further increased risk; the 2-year mortality was 17% when both were below the cut-offs and 2% (p < 0.0001) when both were well preserved (SDNN > 105 ms, BRS > 6.1 ms per mmHg). The association of low SDNN or BRS with LVEF below 35% carried a relative risk of 6.7 (3.1-14.6) or 8.7 (4.3-17.6), respectively, compared with patients with LVEF above 35% and less compromised SDNN ≤ 70 ms) and BRS (≤ 3 ms per mmHg). Interpretation. ATRAMI provides clinical evidence that after myocardial infarction the analysis of vagal reflexes has significant prognostic value independently of LVEF and of ventricular arrhythmias acid that it significantly adds to the prognostic value of heart-rate variability.},

METHODS Narrative review based on published systematic reviews; guidelines; and articles on the yield, benefits, and harms of cardiac screening in low-risk adults. RESULTS Cardiac screening has not been shown to improve patient outcomes. It is also associated with potential harms due to false-positive results because they can lead to subsequent, potentially unnecessary tests and procedures. Cardiac screening is likely to be particularly inefficient in adults at low risk for coronary heart disease given the low prevalence and predictive values of testing in this population and the low likelihood that positive findings will affect treatment decisions. In this patient population, clinicians should focus on strategies for mitigating cardiovascular risk by treating modifiable risk factors (such as smoking, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and overweight) and encouraging healthy levels of exercise. HIGH-VALUE CARE ADVICE Clinicians should not screen for cardiac disease in asymptomatic, low-risk adults with resting or stress electrocardiography, stress echocardiography, or stress myocardial perfusion imaging.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Biofeedback is a self-regulation therapy by which the patient learns how to optimize the functioning of his autonomic nervous system. It has been applied to patients with various cardiovascular disorders. The purpose of this study was to investigate the practical feasibility and the psychophysiological effects of biofeedback applied to heart rate variability (HRV biofeedback) in order to increase cardiac coherence in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients participating in a cardiac rehabilitation programme.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: In this randomised and controlled study, 31 CAD patients were randomly assigned to an experimental or to a control group. The experimental group participated in a programme of 10 sessions of cardiac coherence biofeedback training, in addition to the rehabilitation programme. The control group participated in the usual cardiac rehabilitation programme only. Physiological variables (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, SDNN) and psychosocial variables (anxiety, depression, type D personality) were measured at the start and at the end of the programme in both groups. Statistical comparisons assessed the inter and intra group differences. The small sample size precludes any firm conclusions concerning the effect of cardiac coherence biofeedback on physiological or psychological variables. However, we observed a significant increase of the percentage of cardiac coherence, in relation with an increased SDNN index.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated the practical feasibility of cardiac coherence biofeedback training in CAD patients. Further research is desirable to investigate the potential benefit of cardiac coherence biofeedback as an adjunct to stress management in cardiac rehabilitation.},

abstract = {Objective: Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is a common phenomenon in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and an emerging prognostic factor. Mental stress ischemia is correlated with ambulatory ischemia. However, whether it is related to angina symptoms during daily life has not been examined. Methods: We assessed angina frequency (past month) in 98 post-myocardial infarction (MI) subjects (age 18-60years) using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire. Patients underwent [99mTc]sestamibi SPECT perfusion imaging at rest, after mental stress, and after exercise/pharmacological stress. Summed scores of perfusion abnormalities were obtained by observer-independent software. A summed difference score (SDS), the difference between stress and rest scores, was used to quantify myocardial ischemia under both stress conditions. Results: The mean age was 50. years, 50% were female and 60% were non-white. After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, CAD severity, depressive, anger, and anxiety symptoms, each 1-point increase in mental stress-SDS was associated with 1.73-unit increase in the angina frequency score (95% CI: 0.09-3.37) and 17% higher odds of being in a higher angina frequency category (OR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.00-1.38). Depressive symptoms were associated with 12% higher odds of being in a higher angina frequency category (OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.03-1.21). In contrast, exercise/pharmacological stress-induced SDS was not associated with angina frequency. Conclusion: Among young and middle-aged post-MI patients, myocardial ischemia induced by mental stress in the lab, but not by exercise/pharmacological stress, is associated with higher frequency of retrospectively reported angina during the day. Psychosocial stressors related to mental stress ischemia may be important contributory factor to daily angina.},

abstract = {Summary Previous studies have found a U?shaped relationship between mortality and (weekday) sleep duration. We here address the association of both weekday and weekend sleep duration with overall mortality. A cohort of 43,880 subjects was followed for 13 years through record?linkages. Cox proportional hazards regression models with attained age as time?scale were fitted to estimate multivariable?adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for mortality; stratified analyses on age (<65 years, ≥65 years) were conducted. Among individuals <65 years old, short sleep (≤5 hr) during weekends at baseline was associated with a 52% higher mortality rate (hazard ratios 1.52; 95% confidence intervals 1.15?2.02) compared with the reference group (7 hr), while no association was observed for long (≥9 hr) weekend sleep. When, instead, different combinations of weekday and weekend sleep durations were analysed, we observed a detrimental association with consistently sleeping ≤5 hr (hazard ratios 1.65; 95% confidence intervals 1.22?2.23) or ≥8 hr (hazard ratios 1.25; 95% confidence intervals 1.05?1.50), compared with consistently sleeping 6?7 hr per day (reference). The mortality rate among participants with short sleep during weekdays, but long sleep during weekends, did not differ from the rate of the reference group. Among individuals ≥65 years old, no association between weekend sleep or weekday/weekend sleep durations and mortality was observed. In conclusion, short, but not long, weekend sleep was associated with an increased mortality in subjects <65 years. In the same age group, short sleep (or long sleep) on both weekdays and weekend showed increased mortality. Possibly, long weekend sleep may compensate for short weekday sleep.},

abstract = {Heart development depends on coordinated proliferation and differentiation of cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs), but how the two processes are synchronized is not well understood. Here, we show that the secreted Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) antagonist GREMLIN 2 (GREM2) is induced in CPCs shortly after cardiac mesoderm specification during differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells. GREM2 expression follows cardiac lineage differentiation independently of the differentiation method used, or the origin of the pluripotent stem cells, suggesting that GREM2 is linked to cardiogenesis. Addition of GREM2 protein strongly increases cardiomyocyte output compared to established procardiogenic differentiation methods. Our data show that inhibition of canonical BMP signaling by GREM2 is necessary to promote proliferation of CPCs. However, canonical BMP signaling inhibition alone is not sufficient to induce cardiac differentiation, which depends on subsequent JNK pathway activation specifically by GREM2. These findings may have broader implications in the design of approaches to orchestrate growth and differentiation of pluripotent stem cell-derived lineages that depend on precise regulation of BMP signaling.},

Studies of depressed patients with CHD have also uncovered evidence of ANS dysfunction, including elevated heart rate, low heart rate variability, exaggerated heart rate responses to physical stressors, high variability in ventricular repolarization, and low baroreceptor sensitivity.

abstract = {Background Many anecdotes and several uncontrolled case series have suggested that emotionally stressful events, and more specifically, anger, immediately precede and appear to trigger the onset of acute myocardial infarction. However, controlled studies to determine the relative risk of myocardial infarction after episodes of anger have not been reported. Methods and Results We interviewed 1623 patients (501 women) an average of 4 days after myocardial infarction. The interview identified the time, place, and quality of myocardial infarction pain and other symptoms, the estimated usual frequency of anger during the previous year, and the intensity and timing of anger and other potentially triggering factors during the 26 hours before the onset of myocardial infarction. Anger was assessed by the onset anger scale, a single-item, seven-level, self-report scale, and the state anger subscale of the State-Trait Personality Inventory. Occurrence of anger in the 2 hours preceding the onset of myocardial infarction was compared with its expected frequency using two types of self-matched control data based on the case-crossover study design. The onset anger scale identified 39 patients with episodes of anger in the 2 hours before the onset of myocardial infarction. The relative risk of myocardial infarction in the 2 hours after an episode of anger was 2.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.7 to 3.2). The state anger subscale corroborated these findings with a relative risk of 1.9 (95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 2.7). Regular users of aspirin had a significantly lower relative risk (1.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.8 to 2.6) than nonusers (2.9; 95% confidence interval, 2.0 to 4.1) (P<.05). Conclusions Episodes of anger are capable of triggering the onset of acute myocardial infarction, but aspirin may reduce this risk. A better understanding of the manner in which external events trigger the onset of acute cardiovascular events may lead to innovative preventive strategies aimed at severing the link between these external stressors and their pathological consequences.},

abstract = {Context—Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes. But the utility of screening patients with type 2 diabetes for asymptomatic CAD is controversial. Objective—To assess whether routine screening for CAD identifies patients with type 2 diabetes as being at high cardiac risk and whether it affects their cardiac outcomes. Design, Setting, and Patients—The Detection of Ischemia in Asymptomatic Diabetics (DIAD) study is a randomized controlled trial in which 1123 participants with type 2 diabetes and no symptoms of CAD were randomly assigned to be screened with adenosine-stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) or not to be screened. Participants were recruited from diabetes clinics and practices and prospectively followed up from August 2000 to September 2007. Main Outcome Measure—Cardiac death or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI). Results—The cumulative cardiac event rate was 2.9% over a mean (SD) follow-up of 4.8 (0.9) years for an average of 0.6% per year. Seven nonfatal MIs and 8 cardiac deaths (2.7%) occurred among the screened group and 10 nonfatal MIs and 7 cardiac deaths (3.0%) among the notscreened group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44–1.88; P=.73). Of those in the screened group, 409 participants with normal results and 50 with small MPI defects had lower event rates than the 33 with moderate or large MPI defects; 0.4% per year vs 2.4% per year (HR, 6.3; 95% CI, 1.9–20.1; P=.001). Nevertheless, the positive predictive value of having moderate or large MPI defects was only 12%. The overall rate of coronary revascularization was low in both groups: 31 (5.5%) in the screened group and 44 (7.8%) in the unscreened group (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.45–1.1; P=.14). During the course of study there was a significant and equivalent increase in primary medical prevention in both groups. Conclusion—In this contemporary study population of patients with diabetes, the cardiac event rates were low and were not significantly reduced by MPI screening for myocardial ischemia over 4.8 years.},

However, evidence indicates that the neurogenic control of the heart spans from the maintenance of housekeeping functions in resting conditions to the recruitment of maximal performance, in the fight-or-flight responses, across a whole range of intermediate states. To perform such sophisticated functions, sympathetic ganglia integrate both peripheral and central inputs, and transmit information to the heart via 'motor' neurons, directly interacting with target cardiomyocytes. To date, the dynamics and mode of communication between these two cell types, which determine how neuronal Tania Zaglia, PhD, is a junior group leader at the VIMM, Padova. Her research focuses on the role of cardiac sympathetic innervation in the regulation of cardiomyocyte structure through modulation of intracellular proteostasis. She has discovered how cardiac sympathetic innervation regulates cardiac mass, and identified how alterations in cardiac proteostasis lead to cardiomyopathy. Her research uses in vitro and in vivo models, with various techniques from cellular biochemistry and signalling, to organ physiology. To train her cardiac sympathetic neurons, she works out at the gym. Marco Mongillo, MD, PhD, coordinates the Molecular Cardiology lab at the VIMM, and his main research interests are centred on the intercellular communication of sympathetic neurons with their myocardial cellular targets. He developed and uses novel tools to explore second messenger signalling, using confocal and multiphoton microscopy, electrophysiology and optogenetics, both in cellular models and in vivo. To avoid experimental biases, he refrains from exercise.},

abstract = {The autonomic nervous system (cANS) is essential for proper heart function, and complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias and even sudden cardiac death are associated with an altered cANS function. A changed innervation state may underlie (part of) the atrial and ventricular arrhythmias observed after myocardial infarction. In other cardiac diseases, such as congenital heart disease, autonomic dysfunction may be related to disease outcome. This is also the case after heart transplantation, when the heart is denervated. Interest in the origin of the autonomic nerve system has renewed since the role of autonomic function in disease progression was recognized, and some plasticity in autonomic regeneration is evident. As with many pathological processes, autonomic dysfunction based on pathological innervation may be a partial recapitulation of the early development of innervation. As such, insight into the development of cardiac innervation and an understanding of the cellular background contributing to cardiac innervation during different phases of development is required. This review describes the development of the cANS and focuses on the cellular contributions, either directly by delivering cells or indirectly by secretion of necessary factors or cell-derivatives.},

This analysis identified 13 loci newly associated with CAD at P < 5 × 10⁻⁸ and confirmed the association of 10 of 12 previously reported CAD loci. The 13 new loci showed risk allele frequencies ranging from 0.13 to 0.91 and were associated with a 6% to 17% increase in the risk of CAD per allele. Notably, only three of the new loci showed significant association with traditional CAD risk factors and the majority lie in gene regions not previously implicated in the pathogenesis of CAD.

abstract = {The objectives of this review are to discuss the diversity of mechanisms that may explain the association between heart rate (HR) variability and mortality, to appraise the clinical applicability of traditional and new measures of HR variability and to propose future directions in this field of research. There is a large body of data demonstrating that abnormal HR variability measured over a 24-h period provides information on the risk of subsequent death in subjects with and without structural heart disease. However, the mechanisms responsible for this association are not completely established. Therefore, no specific therapy is currently available to improve the prognosis for patients with abnormal HR variability. Reduced HR variability has been most commonly associated with a risk of arrhythmic death, but recent data suggest that abnormal variability also predicts vascular causes of death, progression of coronary atherosclerosis and death due to heart failure. A consensus is also lacking on the best HR variability measure for clinical purposes. Time and frequency domain measures of HR variability have been most commonly used, but recent studies show that new analysis methods based on nonlinear dynamics may be more powerful in terms of risk stratification. Before the measurement of HR variability can be applied to clinical practice and used to direct therapy, more precise insight into the pathophysiological link between HR variability and mortality are needed. Further studies should also address the issue of which of the HR variability indexes, including the new nonlinear measures, is best for clinical purposes in various patient populations.},

abstract = {Background: The sympathetic nervous system is thought to play a role in the genesis of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT). Left and added right cardiac sympathectomy have been shown to reduce the burden of arrhythmias in the setting of a VT storm. However, the contribution of the right stellate ganglion (RSG) and the left stellate ganglion (LSG) to the innervation of the anterior left ventricular (LV) wall is not well understood. Objective: To evaluate the innervation of the anterior LV wall by the LSG and the RSG. Methods: The heart and stellate ganglia were exposed via sternotomy in pigs with normal hearts (n = 8). A 20-electrode catheter was placed on the anterior LV wall to record activation recovery interval (ARI), a surrogate measure of action potential duration. A microdialysis catheter was inserted in a similar location to sample interstitial norepinephrine (NE) content. ARI and NE measurements were recorded at baseline and during LSG and RSG stimulation. Results: LSG stimulation shortened ARI by 17.1% ± 10.5% (mean ± standard error), while RSG stimulation shortened ARI by 42.1% ± 15.7%, P =.04 (LSG vs RSG). LSG stimulation increased interstitial NE levels by 200% ± 65%, while RSG stimulation increased the NE content by 260% ± 40% (P =.012). LSG stimulation increased dispersion in ARI from 376.0 ± 83.7 ms2 to 1242.5 ± 566 ms2 (P =.03) and caused ventricular fibrillation in 2 pigs. During RSG stimulation, dispersion increased from 419 ± 65.8 to 474.8 ± 81 ms2 (P =.4). Conclusions: Both the LSG and the RSG provide significant innervation to the anterior LV wall as demonstrated by both ARI shortening and NE concentrations. LSG stimulation significantly increases ARI dispersion. This study provides mechanistic insight into the beneficial effects of left sympathectomy and the additional role of right sympathectomy in reducing arrhythmias in patients with anterior myocardial scars and VT storm. {\textcopyright} 2012 Heart Rhythm Society.

abstract = {We have demonstrated previously that sympathetic and vagal afferents travel in an apical-to-basal course in the heart, and can be stimulated selectively with epicardial applications of bradykinin and nicotine, respectively. In this study we tested the hypothesis that transmural myocardial infarction interrupts sympathetic and vagal afferent fibers traveling through the infarction and produces regions of afferent denervation in areas apical to the infarction. In open-chest, chloralose-anesthetized dogs, transmural myocardial infarction was created by embolizing a diagonal branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery with a vinyl latex solution that was injected directly into the artery and hardened rapidly. The transmural nature of the infarction was verified by the nitro blue tetrazolium staining technique for dehydrogenase enzymes. Epicardial applications of bradykinin (5 micrograms) and nicotine (50 micrograms) were used to stimulate chemically sensitive sympathetic and vagal afferent nerve endings, respectively. Twenty-nine dogs were studied before and 90 min after creation of transmural myocardial infarction. In 20 dogs, epicardial bradykinin applied before production of transmural myocardial infarction produced a maximal pressor response of 13 +/- 3 mm Hg 40 sec after application (p less than .01 vs preapplication values), while topical nicotine produced a maximal depressor response of 14 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than .01 vs preapplication values) 20 sec after application at all sites tested. Ninety minutes after production of transmural myocardial infarction, epicardial sites basal to the infarction continued to respond normally to both drugs, while sites within the area of infarction and apical to the area (noninfarcted myocardium) no longer showed a pressor response to topical bradykinin or a depressor response to topical nicotine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {Introduction: Research suggests that people with schizophrenia have autonomic dysfunctions. These have been linked to functioning problems, symptoms and considered a risk factor for illness chronicity. The aim of this study is to introduce a new Mobile Health (mHealth) method using wearable technology to assessing autonomic activity in people's everyday life. We aim to evaluate the new method acceptability and characterise the association between schizophrenia illness features and autonomic abnormalities. Method: Thirty participants with schizophrenia and 25 controls were asked to wear a mHealth device measuring autonomic activity and movements during their normal everyday life. Measures of device use acceptability were collected from all participants. Participants with schizophrenia were also assessed for symptoms and functioning levels. Measures of heart rate variability (HRV), electrodermal activity (EDA) and movement were collected by the device and groups were compared. Correlation between physiological measures, functioning, symptoms and medication levels were assessed in people with schizophrenia. Results: The mHealth device method proved to be acceptable and produced reliable measures of autonomic activity and behaviour. Compared to controls, people with schizophrenia showed lower levels of HRV, movement and functioning. In people with schizophrenia illness severity, particularly positive symptoms, was associated with parasympathetic deregulation. Conclusions: Autonomic abnormalities can be detected using wearable technology from people's everyday life. These are in line with previous research and support the notion that autonomic deregulation are relevant illness features for mental and physical health in schizophrenia. This method may be developed as a monitoring system for well-being and relapse prevention.},

However, there lacks a practical and unobtrusive means to obtain real-time and longitudinal stress information. In this paper, we attempt to derive a convenient HRV-based (heart rate variability) biomarker named cHRV, which can be used to reliably reflect stress dynamics. cHRV's key advantage lies in its low maintenance and high practicality. It can be efficiently calculated only using data from photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, the mainstream heart rate sensor embedded in most of the consumer wearables like Apple Watch. Benefiting from the proliferation of wearables, cHRV is ideal for day-to-day stress monitoring. To evaluate its feasibility and performance, we have conducted 14 in-lab controlled experiments. The result shows that the proposed cHRV has strong correlation with the stress dynamics (r>0.95), therefore exhibits great potential for continuous stress assessment.},

abstract = {Twin studies have long been recognized for their value in learning about the aetiology of disease and specifically for their potential for separating genetic effects from environmental effects. The recent upsurge of interest in life-course epidemiology and the study of developmental influences on later health has provided a new impetus to study twins as a source of unique insights. Twins are of special interest because they provide naturally matched pairs where the confounding effects of a large number of potentially causal factors (such as maternal nutrition or gestation length) may be removed by comparisons between twins who share them. The traditional tool of epidemiological ‘risk factor analysis' is the regression model, but it is not straightforward to transfer standard regression methods to twin data, because the analysis needs to reflect the paired structure of the data, which induces correlation between twins. This paper reviews the use of more specialized regression methods for twin data, based on generalized least squares or linear mixed models, and explains the relationship between these methods and the commonly used approach of analysing within-twin-pair difference values. Methods and issues of interpretation are illustrated using an example from a recent study of the association between birth weight and cord blood erythropoietin. We focus on the analysis of continuous outcome measures but review additional complexities that arise with binary outcomes. We recommend the use of a general model that includes separate regression coefficients for within-twin-pair and between-pair effects, and provide guidelines for the interpretation of estimates obtained under this model.},

abstract = {Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with increased risk of multiple medical problems including myocardial infarction. However, a direct link between PTSD and atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) has not been made. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score is an excellent method to detect atherosclerosis. This study investigated the association of PTSD to atherosclerotic CAD and mortality. Six hundred thirty-seven veterans without known CAD (61 ± 9 years of age, 12.2% women) underwent CAC scanning for clinical indications and their psychological health status (PTSD vs non-PTSD) was evaluated. In subjects with PTSD, CAC was more prevalent than in the non-PTSD cohort (76.1% vs 59%, p = 0.001) and their CAC scores were significantly higher in each Framingham risk score category compared to the non-PTSD group. Multivariable generalized linear regression analysis identified PTSD as an independent predictor of presence and extent of atherosclerotic CAD (p <0.01). During a mean follow-up of 42 months, the death rate was higher in the PTSD compared to the non-PTSD group (15, 17.1%, vs 57, 10.4%, p = 0.003). Multivariable survival regression analyses revealed a significant linkage between PTSD and mortality and between CAC and mortality. After adjustment for risk factors, relative risk (RR) of death was 1.48 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03 to 2.91, p = 0.01) in subjects with PTSD and CAC score >0 compared to subjects without PTSD and CAC score equal to 0. With a CAC score equal to 0, risk of death was not different between subjects with and without PTSD (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.67 to 6.82, p = 0.4). Risk of death in each CAC category was higher in subjects with PTSD compared to matched subjects without PTSD (RRs 1.23 for CAC scores 1 to 100, 1.51 for CAC scores 101 to 400, and 1.81 for CAC scores <400, p <0.05 for all comparisons). In conclusion, PTSD is associated with presence and severity of coronary atherosclerosis and predicts mortality independent of age, gender, and conventional risk factors. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Mechanisms favoring the occurrence of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) are complex and poorly defined. This study was designed to analyze dynamic changes in autonomic tone preceding the onset of PAF in a large group of patients. METHODS AND RESULTS Holter tapes from 77 unselected consecutive patients (63 men and 14 women aged 58+/-12 years) with PAF were analyzed. A total of 147 episodes of sustained AF (>30 minutes) were recorded and submitted to time-domain and frequency-domain heart rate variability analyses; 6 periods were studied using repeated measures ANOVA: the 24-hour period, the hour preceding PAF, and the 20 minutes before PAF divided into four 5-minute periods. In the time-domain analyses, a linear decrease in mean RR interval from 925+/-16 to 906+/-16 ms (P<0.0002) was observed before the onset of PAF, together with a significant increase in the standard deviation of NN intervals from 65+/-4 to 70+/-4 ms (P<0.02). In the frequency-domain analyses, a significant increase in high-frequency (HF, HF-NU) components was observed before PAF (P<0.001 and P<0.0001, respectively), together with a progressive decrease in low-frequency components (LF, LF-NU) (P<0.0001 and P<0.004, respectively). The low/high frequency ratio showed a linear increase until 10 minutes before PAF, followed by a sharp decrease immediately before PAF, suggesting a primary increase in adrenergic tone followed by a marked modulation toward vagal predominance. No difference was observed in these heart rate variability changes between patients with "lone" PAF and patients with structural heart disease. CONCLUSIONS The occurrence of PAF greatly depends on variations of the autonomic tone, with a primary increase in adrenergic tone followed by an abrupt shift toward vagal predominance.},

The goal of this study was to evaluate the relationship between low HRV and SCD in a community-based cohort. Our cohort consisted of 12,543 participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. HRV measures were derived from 2-minute electrocardiogram recordings obtained during the baseline exam (1987–89). Time domain measurements included the standard deviation of all normal RR intervals (SDNN) and the root mean squared successive difference (r-MSSD). Frequency domain measurements included low frequency power (LF) and high frequency (HF) power. During a median follow-up of 13 years, 215 SCDs were identified from physician adjudication of all coronary heart disease deaths through 2001. In multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, each standard deviation decrement in SDNN, LF, and HF were associated with 24%, 27% and 16% increase in SCD risk, respectively. Low HRV is independently associated with increased risk of SCD in the general population.},

abstract = {Background: Findings from family and twin studies suggest that genetic contributions to psychiatric disorders do not in all cases map to present diagnostic categories. We aimed to identify specific variants underlying genetic effects shared between the five disorders in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium: autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia. Methods: We analysed genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for the five disorders in 33 332 cases and 27 888 controls of European ancestory. To characterise allelic effects on each disorder, we applied a multinomial logistic regression procedure with model selection to identify the best-fitting model of relations between genotype and phenotype. We examined cross-disorder effects of genome-wide significant loci previously identified for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and used polygenic risk-score analysis to examine such effects from a broader set of common variants. We undertook pathway analyses to establish the biological associations underlying genetic overlap for the five disorders. We used enrichment analysis of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data to assess whether SNPs with cross-disorder association were enriched for regulatory SNPs in post-mortem brain-tissue samples. Findings: SNPs at four loci surpassed the cutoff for genome-wide significance (p<5×10-8) in the primary analysis: regions on chromosomes 3p21 and 10q24, and SNPs within two L-type voltage-gated calcium channel subunits, CACNA1C and CACNB2. Model selection analysis supported effects of these loci for several disorders. Loci previously associated with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia had variable diagnostic specificity. Polygenic risk scores showed cross-disorder associations, notably between adult-onset disorders. Pathway analysis supported a role for calcium channel signalling genes for all five disorders. Finally, SNPs with evidence of cross-disorder association were enriched for brain eQTL markers. Interpretation: Our findings show that specific SNPs are associated with a range of psychiatric disorders of childhood onset or adult onset. In particular, variation in calcium-channel activity genes seems to have pleiotropic effects on psychopathology. These results provide evidence relevant to the goal of moving beyond descriptive syndromes in psychiatry, and towards a nosology informed by disease cause.},

Spectral analysis of simultaneous R-R and AP variabilities quantified these oscillations that were also evaluated in units normalized by total power to focus on the balance of these two major components. At rest we observed a prevalent HF component (approximately 0.25 Hz) in R-R and AP variabilities that was synchronous with respiration. This HF component of R-R variability disappeared after atropine infusion and can be considered a marker mostly of vagal activity. When baroreceptor unloading, obtained by moderate hypotension, increased sympathetic activity the LF component increased in R-R, systolic, and diastolic AP variabilities. This increase in LF was not present after ganglionic blockade or after chronic arterial baroreceptor denervation. After chronic bilateral stellectomy, hypotension was not accompanied by an increase in LF component of R-R variability, while LF component remained in AP variability. An increase in LF component of R-R and AP variabilities was observed during transient coronary artery occlusion.},

abstract = {The intrinsic cardiac nervous system has been classically considered to contain only parasympathetic efferent postganglionic neurones which receive inputs from medullary parasympathetic efferent preganglionic neurones. In such a view, intrinsic cardiac ganglia act as simple relay stations of parasympathetic efferent neuronal input to the heart, the major autonomic control of the heart purported to reside solely in the brainstem and spinal cord. Data collected over the past two decades indicate that processing occurs within the mammalian intrinsic cardiac nervous system which involves afferent neurones, local circuit neurones (interconnecting neurones) as well as both sympathetic and parasympathetic efferent postganglionic neurones. As such, intrinsic cardiac ganglionic interactions represent the organ component of the hierarchy of intrathoracic nested feedback control loops which provide rapid and appropriate reflex coordination of efferent autonomic neuronal outflow to the heart. In such a concept, the intrinsic cardiac nervous system acts as a distributive processor, integrating parasympathetic and sympathetic efferent centrifugal information to the heart in addition to centripetal information arising from cardiac sensory neurites. A number of neurochemicals have been shown to influence the interneuronal interactions which occur within the intrathoracic cardiac nervous system. For instance, pharmacological interventions that modify b-adrenergic or angiotensin II receptors affect cardiomyocyte function not only directly, but indirectly by influencing the capacity of intrathoracic neurones to regulate cardiomyocytes. Thus, current pharmacological management of heart disease may influence cardiomyocyte function directly as well as indirectly secondary to modifying the cardiac nervous system. This review presents a brief summary of developing concepts about the role of the cardiac nervous system in regulating the normal heart. In addition, it provides some tentative ideas concerning the importance of this nervous system in cardiac disease states with a view to stimulating further interest in neural control of the heart so that appropriate neurocardiological strategies can be devised for the management of heart disease.},

abstract = {The autonomic nervous system plays an integral role in the modulation of normal cardiac electrophysiology. This is achieved via a complex network of pre- and postganglionic sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers that synapse on extrinsic and intrinsic cardiac ganglia and ultimately directly innervate cardiac myocytes. Alterations in autonomic tone may induce changes in local cellular electrophysiology that may manifest clinically in a number of ways, ranging from changes in heart rate to changes in heart rhythm. These relationships between autonomic tone and the evolution of cardiac dysrhythmias are areas of evolving research, with increasing evidence for a key role for autonomic ganglia in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation and sympathetic nerves in the predilection toward ventricular tachycardia in areas of myocardial scar. In this review, we highlight what is known about the anatomy and physiology of the cardiac autonomic nervous system, the evidence supporting the relationship of autonomic tone to clinically significant arrhythmias, and a variety of mechanisms (eg, direct ion channel effects) and diagnostic tools that exist to help define this relationship. Further emphasized are potential future avenues of research needed to elucidate the relationship between changes in normal autonomic tone and the pathogenesis of cardiac arrhythmias.},

Timely prediction of VTA, using heart rate variability (HRV) analysis techniques, may facilitate the implementation of preventive and therapeutic strategies.\n\nAIM: To evaluate the novel multipole method of the HRV analysis in prediction of imminent VTAs in ICD patients.\n\nMETHODS: We screened patients from the Biotronik HAWAI Registry (Heart Rate Analysis with Automated ICDs). A total of 28 patients from the HAWAI registries (phase I and II), having medical records, who had experienced documented, verified VTA during the 2-year follow-up, were included in our analysis. HRV during preepisode recordings of 4,500 R-R intervals were analyzed using the Dyx parameter and compared to HRV of similar length recordings from the same patients that were not followed by arrhythmia.\n\nRESULTS: Our study population consisted mainly of men 25 of 28 (89%), average age of 64.8 ± 9.4 years, 92% with coronary artery disease. HRV during 64 preevent recordings (2.3 events per patient on average) was analyzed and compared with 60 control recordings. The multipole method of HRV analysis showed 50% sensitivity and 91.6% specificity for prediction of ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation in the study population, with 84.5% positive predictive value. No statistically significant correlation was found between various clinical parameters and the sensitivity of imminent VTA predetection in our patients.\n\nCONCLUSION: The multipole method of HRV analysis emerges as a highly specific, possible predictor of imminent VTA, providing an early warning allowing to prepare for an arrhythmic episode.},

abstract = {The effect of psychologic stress on cardiac vulnerability was examined in 10 conscious dogs. The repetitive extrasystole threshold wasemployed as a measure of susceptibility to ventricular fibrillation. Instrumental aversive conditioning constituted a stressful environment. The repetitive extrasystole threshold decreased by nearly 50 percent during 3 days in which the animals were exposed to the stressful environment. When Tolamolol hydrochloride, a cardioselective beta adrenoceptor blocking agent, was administered before a stress session, the repetitive extra-systole threshold was unaltered from the control value. Thus, stress-evoked changes in cardiac vulnerabilityare mediated through the sympathetic nervous system. The role of psychologic stress in predisposing to cardiac arrhythmias is well recognized clinically. However, precise data documenting this relation have been difficult to obtain in man or in the animal laboratory. With growing interest in the problem of sudden death due to ventricular fibrillation, attention has been devoted to alterations in ventricular vulnerability during various stressful states. Recently it has been demonstrated in dogs that the threshold of the ventricular vulnerable period for eliciting repetitive extrasystoles is significantly lower in an aversive than in a placid environment. 1 It has also been found that animals placed in stressful restraint after myocardial infarction experience ventricular arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia. 2 In pigs protected against psychologic stress, the onset of ventricular fibrillation after coronary arterial ligation is either retarded or entirely prevented, u Moreover, pharmacologically restrained pigs subjected to electrical stimulation undergo severe acute cardiomyopathy and 13 percent die suddenly. 4 This study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of psychologic stress upon ventricular electrical stability in the conscious dog. The assumption entertained was that a change in cardiac electrical stability was associated with increased susceptibility to ventricular fibrillation. 5 The underlying hypothesis was that a psychologically stressful environment would increase cardiac electrical instability. Instrumental aversive conditioning was the experimental paradigm employed to produce psychologic stress. 6-s Since certain types of stressors in man affect cardiac function through sympathetic nervous mediation, 9 these studies were performed with and without blockade of beta adrenergic activity. Cardiac electrical stability was determined by measuring the threshold current necessary to provoke repetitive ventricular extrasystoles. It has been demonstrated that the repetitive extrasystole threshold can be used as a precise measure of the vulnerable period threshold for ventricular fibrillation.I, lo Methods Ten mongrel dogs, weighing 8.5 to 17 kg, were anesthetized with intravenously administered sodium pentobarbital, 32.5 mg/kg body weight.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) is frequent in patients with coronary artery disease and is associated with worse prognosis. Young women with a previous myocardial infarction (MI), a group with unexplained higher mortality than men of comparable age, have shown elevated rates of MSIMI, but the mechanisms are unknown. METHODS We studied 306 patients (150 women and 156 men) ≤61 years of age who were hospitalized for MI in the previous 8 months and 112 community controls (58 women and 54 men) frequency matched for sex and age to the patients with MI. Endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation and microvascular reactivity (reactive hyperemia index) were measured at rest and 30 minutes after mental stress. The digital vasomotor response to mental stress was assessed using peripheral arterial tonometry. Patients received 99mTc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging at rest, with mental (speech task) and conventional (exercise/pharmacological) stress. RESULTS The mean age of the sample was 50 years (range, 22-61). In the MI group but not among controls, women had a more adverse socioeconomic and psychosocial profile than men. There were no sex differences in cardiovascular risk factors, and among patients with MI, clinical severity tended to be lower in women. Women in both groups showed a higher peripheral arterial tonometry ratio during mental stress but a lower reactive hyperemia index after mental stress, indicating enhanced microvascular dysfunction after stress. There were no sex differences in flow-mediated dilation changes with mental stress. The rate of MSIMI was twice as high in women as in men (22% versus 11%, P=0.009), and ischemia with conventional stress was similarly elevated (31% versus 16%, P=0.002). Psychosocial and clinical risk factors did not explain sex differences in inducible ischemia. Although vascular responses to mental stress (peripheral arterial tonometry ratio and reactive hyperemia index) also did not explain sex differences in MSIMI, they were predictive of MSIMI in women only. CONCLUSIONS Young women after MI have a 2-fold likelihood of developing MSIMI compared with men and a similar increase in conventional stress ischemia. Microvascular dysfunction and peripheral vasoconstriction with mental stress are implicated in MSIMI among women but not among men, perhaps reflecting women's proclivity toward ischemia because of microcirculatory abnormalities.},

abstract = {This review examines current knowledge of the effects of higher brain centres and autonomic control loops on the heart with particular relevance to arrhythmogenesis. There is now substantial evidence that higher brain function (cortex), the brain stem and autonomic nerves affect cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia, and that these may function as an interactive system. The roles of mental stress and emotion in arrhythmogenesis and sudden cardiac death are no longer confined to the realms of anecdote. Advances in molecular cardiology have identified cardiac cellular ion channel mutations conferring vulnerability to arrhythmic death at the myocardial level. Indeed, specific channelopathies such as long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome are selectively sensitive to either sympathetic or vagal stimulation. There is increasing evidence that afferent feedback from the heart to the higher centres may affect efferent input to the heart and modulate the cardiac electrophysiology. The new era of functional neuroimaging has identified the central neural circuitry in this brain-heart axis. Since precipitants of sudden fatal arrhythmia are frequently environmental and behavioural, central pathways translating stress into autonomic effects on the heart might be considered as therapeutic targets. These brain-heart interactions help explain the apparent randomness of sudden cardiac events and provide new insights into future novel therapies to prevent sudden death.},

This article briefly reviews current perspectives on the mechanisms that generate 24 h, short-term ($\sim$5 min), and ultra-short-term (<5 min) HRV, the importance of HRV, and its implications for health and performance. The authors provide an overview of widely-used HRV time-domain, frequency-domain, and non-linear metrics. Time-domain indices quantify the amount of HRV observed during monitoring periods that may range from $\sim$2 min to 24 h. Frequency-domain values calculate the absolute or relative amount of signal energy within component bands. Non-linear measurements quantify the unpredictability and complexity of a series of IBIs. The authors survey published normative values for clinical, healthy, and optimal performance populations. They stress the importance of measurement context, including recording period length, subject age, and sex, on baseline HRV values. They caution that 24 h, short-term, and ultra-short-term normative values are not interchangeable. They encourage professionals to supplement published norms with findings from their own specialized populations. Finally, the authors provide an overview of HRV assessment strategies for clinical and optimal performance interventions.},

abstract = {Both the prevalence and incidence of heart failure (HF) are increasing, especially among African Americans, but no large-scale, genome-wide association study (GWAS) of HF-related metabolites has been reported. We sought to identify novel genetic variants that are associated with metabolites previously reported to relate to HF incidence. GWASs of three metabolites identified previously as risk factors for incident HF (pyroglutamine, dihydroxy docosatrienoic acid, and X-11787, being either hydroxy-leucine or hydroxy-isoleucine) were performed in 1,260 African Americans free of HF at the baseline examination of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. A significant association on chromosome 5q33 (rs10463316, MAF = 0.358, P-value = 1.92 × 10(-10) ) was identified for pyroglutamine. One region on chromosome 2p13 contained a nonsynonymous substitution in N-acetyltransferase 8 (NAT8) was associated with X-11787 (rs13538, MAF = 0.481, P-value = 1.71 × 10(-23) ). The smallest P-value for dihydroxy docosatrienoic acid was rs4006531 on chromosome 8q24 (MAF = 0.400, P-value = 6.98 × 10(-7) ). None of the above SNPs were individually associated with incident HF, but a genetic risk score (GRS) created by summing the most significant risk alleles from each metabolite detected 11% greater risk of HF per allele. In summary, we identified three loci associated with previously reported HF-related metabolites. Further use of metabolomics technology will facilitate replication of these findings in independent samples.},

abstract = {Power spectrum analysis of heart rate variability (PSA of HRV) is a promising method, which can be used as an index of cardiac autonomic balance. PSA of HRV is a noninvasive technique, based on ECG sampling of RR interval variation, thus providing a dynamic assessment of sympathetic and parasympathetic tone, reflecting the interactions between the two. It has been shown to have potential value in various laboratory and clinical conditions. It is influenced by many factors such as age, sex, position, breathing, smoking, hour of the day and medications. Different methods of data processing by various authors have often elicited conflicting results. Standard values are not yet available to be used or compared in different settings. From the interest it has raised, it may be expected that this method will be in widespread use in clinical practice in the future, providing a useful tool, both for diagnostic and prognostic purposes, as well as serving as a further aid towards monitoring therapeutic interventions. This review highlights techniques of dynamic assessment of HRV and studies of its clinical applications in psychiatry in particular. It raises the potentially important prognostic implications of protracted autonomic dysfunction in psychiatric patient populations, especially for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute mental stress evokes responses in the cardiovascular and the immune systems. In particular, the subset of natural killer (NK) cells is found to be responsive to mental stress. The role of beta-adrenergic mechanisms in these processes in the subject of this investigation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Healthy male volunteers (n = 31) were subjected to two consecutive mental tasks. Subjects were randomly assigned to a beta-blocker (propranolol 40 mg) or a placebo group. The capsules were ingested 1 hour before the tasks. The tasks evoked sympathetic responses, as indicated by an increase in heart rate and a decrease in the preejection period. These effects were abolished under beta-blockade, indicating that effective beta-blockade was achieved. In the immune system, significant increases were found for the number of NK cells and NK cell activity in the placebo group; these increases were absent in the propranolol group. In addition, an increase in all lymphocyte subsets was observed in subjects who had ingested propranolol. This increase, however, was also observed in subjects who had received propranolol but had not performed the tasks, indicating that these non-subset-specific increases in lymphocytes were a side effect of the beta-blocker. CONCLUSIONS: Mental stress induces activation of the sympathetic nervous system, with concomitant increases in the number of NK cells in the circulation. These changes were inhibited by propranolol, indicating that stress-induced increases in the number and activity of NK cells in the circulation are controlled by a beta-adrenergic mechanism.},

METHODS: Time and frequency heart rate variability (HRV) and visual rating of WMLs were carried out in 42 patients with mild cognitive impairment. RESULTS: After adjustment for relevant demographic and clinical characteristics, including left ventricular mass, reduced HRV indices of parasympathetic (root mean square of successive difference of RR intervals, RMSSD) and sympathetic modulation (low-frequency [LF] power) were associated with increased WML score (RMSSD: B -0.30, 95% CI -0.52 to -0.08, p = .01; LF: B -0.24, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.02, p = .05). In a multiple-adjusted model, RMSSD was the major independent predictor of WMLs (B -0.35, 95% CI -0.57 to -0.13, p = .002). CONCLUSION: The evidence for an independent association of cardiac autonomic dysfunction with WMLs might suggest its role in the pathogenesis of WMLs.},

abstract = {Objectives: This study sought to assess the long-term predictive power of depressed baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) among post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients with preserved left ventricular function. Background: Risk stratification after MI is primarily performed by identifying patients with depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) because of their greater mortality. Autonomic markers can help refining risk stratification. Depressed BRS (<3 ms/mm Hg) correlated with cardiovascular mortality in 1,284 post-MI patients during a 21-month follow-up in the multicenter ATRAMI (Autonomic Tone and Reflexes After Myocardial Infarction) study, but had no significant predictive power in patients with LVEF >35% or above age 65 years. Methods: Two hundred forty-four consecutive post-MI patients (age 59 ± 10 years) with LVEF >35% (average 54 ± 8%) were enrolled. They underwent a complete assessment, including BRS 4 weeks after MI. Results: During a 5-year mean follow-up, 14 (5.7%) patients died of cardiovascular causes. Multivariate analysis identified BRS (p = 0.0001), but not LVEF and age, as predictive of cardiovascular mortality. The relative risk (95% confidence interval [CI]) for depressed BRS was 11.4 (95% CI 3.3 to 39.0) for the overall population, 19.6 (95% CI 4.1 to 94.8) for patients ≤65 years, and 7.2 (95% CI 1.3 to 39.9) for patients above age 65. Conclusions: Even among the large number of low-risk post-MI patients with preserved left ventricular function, depressed BRS identifies, independently of age, a subgroup at long-term high risk for cardiovascular mortality in which more aggressive preventive strategies should be considered. {\textcopyright} 2007 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {Autonomic function during sleep and wakefulness has been extensively investigated, however information concerning autonomic changes during the wake to sleep transition is scarce. The objective of the present study was to non-invasively characterize autonomic function and additional physiologic changes during sleep onset in normal and abnormal sleep. The estimation of autonomic function was based on time-frequency analysis of the RR interval series, using the power components in the very-low-frequency range (0.005-0.04 Hz), low-frequency (0.04-0.15 Hz), and high-frequency range (0.15-0.5 Hz). The ratio of low to high frequency power represented the sympathovagal balance. Thirty-four subjects who underwent whole night polysomnography were divided into 3 groups according to their complaints and study results: normal subjects, apneic patients (OSAS), and subjects with various sleep disorders (VSD). The results indicated a significant increase in RR interval during sleep onset, although its variability decreased; respiratory rate did not change, yet respiration became more stable; EMG amplitude and its variability decreased with sleep onset. Very-low-frequency power started to decrease significantly 2 min before sleep onset in all groups; low-frequency power decreased and high-frequency power did not change significantly in all groups, accordingly their ratio decreased and reflected a shift towards parasympathetic predominance. Although autonomic function displayed similar behavior in all subjects, OSAS and VSD patients presented a higher sympathovagal balance reflecting enhanced sympathetic predominance in those groups compared to normal subjects, both before and after sleep onset. All parameters reached a nadir at a defined time point during the process of falling asleep. We conclude that the wake-sleep transition period represents a transitional process between two physiologically different states; this transition starts with a decrease in the very slow oscillations in heart rate that anticipates a step-change resetting of autonomic function, followed by a decrease in sympathovagal balance towards the end of the process. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In a longitudinal cohort of 2160 combat troops in the 2-phase Marine Resiliency Study (MRS), they examined whether predeployment HRV predicts postdeployment PTSD among US Marines being deployed for combat. The investigators found that the low- to high-frequency (LF:HF) HRV ratio predicted postdeployment PTSD, evenafter adjusting for differences in deployment-related stressors. The study by Minassian et al, however, has several weaknesses that limit its ability to infer a causal association between a higher LF:HF HRV ratio and the incidence of postdeployment PTSD. The study by Minassian et al, along with other studies from the MRS cohort, provide important initial data to help identify key determinants and prognostic indicators of PTSD after a major trauma.

We evaluated the autonomic response to stress reactivity of young healthy subjects and aging subjects with coronary artery disease to understand how the autonomic stress response differs with aging. Methods Physiologic reactivity to arithmetic stress in a cohort of 25 young, healthy subjects (< 30 years) and another cohort of 25 older subjects (> 55 years) with CAD was evaluated using electrocardiography, impedance cardiography, and arterial pressure recordings. Stress-related changes in the pre-ejection period (PEP), which measures sympathetic activity, and high frequency heart rate variability (HF HRV), which measures parasympathetic activity, were analyzed as primary outcomes. Results Mental stress reduced PEP in both groups (p<0.01), although the decrease was 50% greater in the healthy group. Mean HF HRV decreased significantly in the aging group only (p = 0.01). Discussion PEP decreases with stress regardless of health and age status, implying increased sympathetic function. Its decline with stress may be attenuated in CAD. The HF HRV (parasympathetic) stress reactivity is more variable and attenuated in younger individuals; perhaps this is related to a protective parasympathetic reflex.

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV), the beat-to-beat variation in either heart rate or the duration of the R-R interval - the heart period, has become a popular clinical and investigational tool. The temporal fluctuations in heart rate exhibit a marked synchrony with respiration (increasing during inspiration and decreasing during expiration - the so called respiratory sinus arrhythmia, RSA) and are widely believed to reflect changes in cardiac autonomic regulation. Although the exact contributions of the parasympathetic and the sympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system to this variability are controversial and remain the subject of active investigation and debate, a number of time and frequency domain techniques have been developed to provide insight into cardiac autonomic regulation in both health and disease. It is the purpose of this essay to provide an historical overview of the evolution in the concept of HRV. Briefly, pulse rate was first measured by ancient Greek physicians and scientists. However, it was not until the invention of the "Physician's Pulse Watch" (a watch with a second hand that could be stopped) in 1707 that changes in pulse rate could be accurately assessed. The Rev. Stephen Hales (1733) was the first to note that pulse varied with respiration and in 1847 Carl Ludwig was the first to record RSA. With the measurement of the ECG (1895) and advent of digital signal processing techniques in the 1960s, investigation of HRV and its relationship to health and disease has exploded. This essay will conclude with a brief description of time domain, frequency domain, and non-linear dynamic analysis techniques (and their limitations) that are commonly used to measure HRV.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Johns Hopkins Precursors Study is a prospective, observational study of 1190 male medical students who were enrolled between 1948 and 1964 and who continued to be followed up. In medical school and through the follow-up period, information was collected on family history, health behaviors, and clinical depression. Cardiovascular disease end points have been assessed with reviews of annual questionnaires, National Death Index searches, medical records, death certificates, and autopsy reports. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of clinical depression in the medical students at 40 years of follow-up was 12%. Men who developed clinical depression drank more coffee than those who did not but did not differ in terms of baseline blood pressure, serum cholesterol levels, smoking status, physical activity, obesity, or family history of coronary artery disease. In multivariate analysis, the men who reported clinical depression were at significantly greater risk for subsequent coronary heart disease (relative risk [RR], 2.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-3.63) and myocardial infarction (RR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.11-4.06). The increased risk associated with clinical depression was present even for myocardial infarctions occurring 10 years after the onset of the first depressive episode (RR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1-4.0). CONCLUSION: Clinical depression appears to be an independent risk factor for incident coronary artery disease for several decades after the onset of the clinical depression.},

abstract = {Spectral analysis was used to investigate variations of heart period in 13 decerebrate cats under different conditions of neural input to the heart. Spectral density plots in intact animals showed three well-defined peaks: P1 (1.5-2.5 cycles/min), P2 (6-10 cycles/min), and P2 (respiratory frequency). In the presence of sympathetic input only the amplitudes of all peaks were decreased; when only vagal input was present the amplitudes of P1 and P2 were increased and there was no change in P3; when neither sympathetic nor vagal input was present the amplitudes of all peaks were decreased. In addition, the amplitudes of P1 and P2 were increased and there was no change in P3; when neither sympathetic nor vagal input was present the amplitudes of all peaks were decreased. In addition, the amplitudes of P1 and P2 were found to be significantly correlated with the mean heart period under the condition of vagal control only. It is concluded that P3 is related to sinus arrhythmia and that P1 and P2 may be related to spontaneous rhythms that are an intrinsic feature of the dynamic regulation of heart period by the vagus system. Sympathetic activity plays no role in the genesis of these rhythms.},

In both sexes, at all ages, all-cause, cardiovascular, and coronary mortality rates increased progressively in relation to antecedent heart rates determined biennially. A more impressive association to cardiovascular disease was observed in men than in women, which was independent of associated cardiovascular risk factors. Case fatality rates following coronary events also increased with antecedent heart rate and the fraction of coronary deaths as sudden death increased strikingly with heart rate in men 35 to 64 years of age. There was also a substantial excess of noncardiovascular deaths at high heart rates, and the proportion of all deaths resulting from cardiovascular disease did not increase with heart rate. The excess cardiovascular deaths with more rapid heart rates were also noted, excluding those with interim overt cardiovascular disease, suggesting an effect independent of preexisting cardiac damage. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

abstract = {Background. Physicians use myocardial perfusion imaging to a variable extent in patients presenting with possible coronary artery disease. There are few clinical data on the most cost-effective strategy although computer models predict that routine use of myocardial perfusion imaging is cost-effective. Objectives. To measure the cost-effectiveness of four diagnostic strategies in patients newly presenting with possible coronary artery disease, and to compare cost-effectiveness in centres that routinely use myocardial perfusion imaging with those that do not. Methods. We have studied 396 patients presenting to eight hospitals for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. The hospitals were regular users or non-users of myocardial perfusion imaging with one of each in four countries (France, Germany, Italy, United Kingdom). Information was gathered retrospectively on presentation, investigations, complications, and clinical management, and patients were followed-up for 2 years in order to assess outcome. Pre- and post-test probabilities of coronary artery disease were computed for diagnostic tests and each test was also assigned as diagnostic or part of management. Diagnostic strategies defined were. 1: Exercise electrocardiogram/coronary angiography, 2: exercise electrocardiogram/myocardial perfusion imaging/coronary angiography, 3: myocardial perfusion imaging/coronary angiography, 4: coronary angiography. Primary outcome measures were the cost and accuracy of diagnosis, the cost of subsequent management, and clinical outcome. Secondary measures included prognostic power, normal angiography rate, and rate of angiography not followed by revascularization. Results. Mean diagnostic costs per patient were: strategy 1: {\pounds}490, 2: {\pounds}409, 3: {\pounds}460, 4: {\pounds}1253 (P < 0.0001). Myocardial perfusion imaging users: {\pounds}529, non-users {\pounds}667 (P= 0.006). Mean probability of the presence of corollary artery disease when the final clinical diagnosis was coronary artery disease present were, strategy 1: 0.85, 2: 0.82, 3: 0.97, 4: 1.0 (P < 0.0001), users 0.93, non-users 0.88 (P = 0.02), and when coronary artery disease was absent, 1: 0.26, 2: 0.22, 3: 0.16, 4: 0.0 (P < 0.0001), users 0.21, non-users 0.20 (P = ns). Total 2-year costs (coronary artery disease present/absent) were: strategy 1: {\pounds}4453/{\pounds}710, 2: {\pounds}3842/{\pounds}478, 3: {\pounds}3768/{\pounds}574, 4: {\pounds}5599/{\pounds}1475 (P < 0.05/0.0001), users: {\pounds}5563/{\pounds}623, non-users: {\pounds}5428/{\pounds}916 (P = ns/0.001). Prognostic power at diagnosis was higher (P < 0.0001) and normal coronary angiography rate lower (P = 0.07) in the scintigraphic centres and strategies. Numbers of soft and hard cardiac events over 2 years and final symptomatic status did not differ between strategy or centre. Conclusion. Investigative strategies using myocardial perfusion imaging are cheaper and equally effective when compared with strategies that do not use myocardial perfusion imaging, both for cost of diagnosis and for overall 2 year management costs. Two year patient outcome is the same.},

abstract = {Background: An efficient cardiac rehabilitation programme (CRP) can improve the functional ability of patients after acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Objective: To examine the effect of a CRP on parasympathetic reactivation and heart rate recovery (HRR) measured after a 6-min walk test (6MWT), and correlation with 6MWT distance and well-being after ACS. Methods: Eleven normoweight patients after ACS (BMI < 25 kg/m2; 10 males; mean [SD] age 61 [9] years) underwent an 8-week CRP. Before (pre-) and at weeks 4 (W4) and 8 (W8) during the CRP, they performed a 6MWT on a treadmill, followed by 10-min of seated passive recovery, with HRR and HR variability (HRV) recordings. HRR was measured at 1, 3, 5 and 10 min after the 6MWT (HRR1, HRR3, HRR5, HRR10), then modelized by a mono-exponential function. Time-domain (square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of differences between adjacent normal R-R intervals [RMSSD]) and frequency-domain (with high- and low-frequency band powers) were used to analyse HRV. Participants completed a mental and physical well-being questionnaire at pre- and W8. Exhaustion after tests was assessed by the Borg scale. Pearson correlation was used to assess correlations. Results: HRR3, HRR5 and HRR10 increased by 37%, 36% and 28%, respectively, between pre- and W8 (P < 0.05), and were positively correlated with change in 6MWT distance (r = 0.58, 0.66 and 0.76; P < 0.05). Percentage change in HRR3 was positively correlated with change in well-being (r = 0.70; P = 0.01). Parasympathic reactivation (RMSSD) was improved only during the first 30 sec of recovery (P = 0.04). Conclusion: Among patients undergoing a CRP after ACS, increased HRR after a 6MWT, especially at 3 min, was positively correlated with 6MWT distance and improved well-being. HRR raw data seem more sensitive than post-exercise HRV analysis for monitoring functional and autonomic improvement after ACS.},

abstract = {Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with an increased risk of ischemic heart disease, though the pathophysiologic mechanisms remain unclear. Carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT) is a measure of subclinical atherosclerosis. We examined whether PTSD and combat exposure were associated with CIMT in Vietnam War-era twins after controlling for shared genetic and childhood factors. Between 2002 and 2010, we studied 465 middle-aged twins from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry who were free from cardiovascular disease. PTSD was diagnosed using the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, and CIMT was measured by ultrasound. Mixed-effects regression models were used to examine individual, between-pair, and within-pair associations. Approximately 13% of participants met the criteria for PTSD, and 45% served in the Vietnam Theater. PTSD was associated with 32.7 $\mu$m higher CIMT (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.9, 64.5) after adjustment for confounders. The average CIMT for the pair increased by 59.7 $\mu$m for each additional twin with PTSD (95% CI: 15.9, 104.2). We found no significant within-pair differences in CIMT when comparing PTSD-discordant co-twins. Results for combat exposure were similar, but its association with CIMT weakened after adjustment for PTSD (95% CI: 7.0, 45.3). Among Vietnam War-era veterans, combat exposure and PTSD are associated with CIMT, though the associations are largely mediated by shared childhood factors.},

abstract = {1. Myocardial ischaemia and infarction activate vagal and sympathetic sensory endings in the ischaemic myocardium, resulting in powerful reflex effects. The vagal afferents are either mechano- or chemosensitive, whereas sympathetic afferents may be mechano-, chemosensitive or both. 2. Activation of vagal afferents results in sympathoinhibitory, cardioinhibitory, vasodepressor responses. Cardiac sympathetic afferents activated during myocardial ischaemia mediate sympathoexcitatory, vasoconstrictor cardioaccelerator responses. 3. The focus of the present review is on the activation of sympathetic afferents by myocardial ischaemia and on the resulting reflex responses that they mediate. 4. These endings are more likely to be activated as the degree of ischaemia progresses from subendocardial towards transmural. They are evenly distributed between the anterior and inferoposterior wall. Although it has been suggested that these endings are activated by bradykinin, recent evidence indicates that they are activated by adenosine released from the ischaemic myocardium. Results from our laboratory indicate that this effect is due to the activation of adenosine A1, but not adenosine A2 receptors. 5. Activation of ventricular vagal and sympathetic afferent fibres during myocardial ischaemia in humans is responsible for the autonomic changes observed and, in the case of the sympathetic afferents, for the sensation of angina pectoris.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To clarify the relationship between depression and heart rate variability (HRV) in a sample of twins. Reduced HRV, a measure of autonomic dysfunction, has been linked to depression but many studies have inadequately controlled for familial and environmental factors. Furthermore, little is known about whether depression and HRV share common genetic pathways.\n\nMETHODS: We performed power spectral analysis on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms in 288 middle-aged male twins. Log-normalized ultra low, very low, low, high frequency, and total power were calculated. A lifetime history of major depressive disorder (MDD) was determined, using the Structured Clinical Interview for Psychiatry Disorders, and current depressive symptoms were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory. Mixed-effect regression models were used to account for intrapair variability and estimate within-pair effects at the same time controlling for potential confounders.\n\nRESULTS: Both current depressive symptoms and a history of MDD were significantly associated with lower HRV. There was a graded effect, and power in each frequency band was 29% to 36% lower in the lowest band compared with the highest BDI category. All HRV measures except high frequency remained significantly associated with current depressive symptoms in multivariable analysis, but not with lifetime history of MDD. When analyses were stratified by zygosity, a significant within-pair association between BDI score and HRV was found in the dizygotic but not in the monozygotic twins, suggesting a genetic influence on the association.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: A shared, genetically influenced biological pathway underlies the association between depression and lower HRV. These two phenotypes may be the expression of a generalized neurobiological perturbation.},

@article{Houle1999,
abstract = {The low-frequency component of the heart rate variability spectrum (0.06-0.10 Hz) is often used as an accurate reflection of sympathetic activity. Therefore, interventions that enhance cardiac sympathetic drive, e.g., exercise and myocardial ischemia, should elicit increases in the low-frequency power. Furthermore, because an enhanced sympathetic activation has been linked to an increased propensity for malignant arrhythmias, one might also predict a greater low-frequency power in animals that are susceptible to ventricular fibrillation than in resistant animals. To test these hypotheses, a 2-min coronary occlusion was made during the last minute of exercise in 71 dogs with healed myocardial infarctions: 43 had ventricular fibrillation (susceptible) and 28 did not experience arrhythmias (resistant). Exercise or ischemia alone provoked significant heart rate increases in both groups of animals, with the largest increase in the susceptible animals. These heart rate increases were attenuated by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. Despite the sympathetically mediated increases in heart rate, the low-frequency power decreased, rather than increased, in both groups, with the largest decrease again in the susceptible animals: 4.0 +/- 0.2 (susceptible) vs. 4.1 +/- 0.2 ln ms2 (resistant) in preexercise control and 2.2 +/- 0.2 (susceptible) vs. 2.9 +/- 0.2 ln ms2 (resistant) at highest exercise level. In a similar manner the parasympathetic antagonist atropine sulfate elicited significant reductions in the low-frequency power. Although sympathetic nerve activity was not directly recorded, these data suggest that the low-frequency component of the heart rate power spectrum probably results from an interaction of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems and, as such, does not accurately reflect changes in the sympathetic activity.},

abstract = {Cardiovascular autonomic diabetic neuropathy (CADN) may carry an increased risk of mortality. However, in previous studies the prognosis of patients with CADN seemed to be influenced by life-threatening macro- and microvascular complications which had already been present at the start of the study period. Between 1981 and 1983, 1015 diabetic patients have been examined for CADN (abnormal heart rate variation at rest and during deep respiration) at the Diabetes Research Institute, Dusseldorf. Thirty-five patients (28 with Type 1 diabetes, 7 with Type 2 diabetes) with CADN have been retrospectively recruited and reviewed 8 years later and compared with 35 patients without CADN who were matched for sex, age, and duration of diabetes. Exclusion criteria for entry into the study included severe micro- or macrovascular complications, such as proliferative retinopathy, proteinuria or symptomatic coronary artery disease. During the 8-year observation period, 8 patients with CADN and 1 patient without CADN died. The survival rate estimates steadily declined in patients with CADN over the whole period studied. The 8-year survival rate estimate in patients with CADN was 77% compared with 97% in those with normal autonomic function (p < 0.05). Deaths were mainly due to macrovascular diseases (n = 3) and sudden unexpected deaths (n = 3). One patient with CADN died after an episode of severe hypoglycaemia. Among the deceased patients, coefficient of variation of R-R intervals during deep breathing was significantly reduced when compared with those who survived (1.04 (plus or minus) 0.5% vs 1.87 (plus or minus) 1.0%; p < 0.05), and symptoms of autonomic neuropathy (orthostatic hypotension, gastroparesis, gustatory sweating) were more frequent (7/8 vs 10/27 patients). The mean QTc interval was not different between the groups. These results suggest a relatively poor prognosis of patients with CADN in the absence of clinically detectable micro- and macrovascular complications.},

abstract = {Personality traits are summarized by five broad dimensions with pervasive influences on major life outcomes, strong links to psychiatric disorders and clear heritable components. To identify genetic variants associated with each of the five dimensions of personality we performed a genome-wide association (GWA) scan of 3972 individuals from a genetically isolated population within Sardinia, Italy. On the basis of the analyses of 362 129 single-nucleotide polymorphisms we found several strong signals within or near genes previously implicated in psychiatric disorders. They include the association of neuroticism with SNAP25 (rs362584, P=5 x 10(-5)), extraversion with BDNF and two cadherin genes (CDH13 and CDH23; Ps<5 x 10(-5)), openness with CNTNAP2 (rs10251794, P=3 x 10(-5)), agreeableness with CLOCK (rs6832769, P=9 x 10(-6)) and conscientiousness with DYRK1A (rs2835731, P=3 x 10(-5)). Effect sizes were small (less than 1% of variance), and most failed to replicate in the follow-up independent samples (N up to 3903), though the association between agreeableness and CLOCK was supported in two of three replication samples (overall P=2 x 10(-5)). We infer that a large number of loci may influence personality traits and disorders, requiring larger sample sizes for the GWA approach to confidently identify associated genetic variants.},

abstract = {Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether coronary heart disease (CHD)-susceptibility loci identified by genome-wide association studies of the general population also contribute to CHD in type 2 diabetes. Background: No study has examined the effects of these genetic variants on CHD in diabetic patients. Methods: We genotyped 15 genetic markers of 12 loci in 3 studies of diabetic patients: the prospective Nurses' Health Study (309 CHD cases, and 544 control subjects) and Health Professional Follow-up Study (345 CHD cases, and 451 control subjects) and the cross-sectional Joslin Heart Study (422 CHD cases, and 435 control subjects). Results: Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms, rs4977574 (CDKN2A/2B), rs12526453 (PHACTR1), rs646776 (CELSR2-PSRC1-SORT1), rs2259816 (HNF1A), and rs11206510 (PCSK9) showed directionally consistent associations with CHD in the 3 studies, with combined odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 1.17 to 1.25 (p = 0.03 to 0.0002). None of the other single-nucleotide polymorphisms reached significance in individual or combined analyses. A genetic risk score (GRS) was created by combining the risk alleles of the 5 significantly associated loci. The OR of CHD/GRS unit was 1.19 (95% confidence interval: 1.13 to 1.26; p < 0.0001). Individuals with GRS <8 (19% of diabetic subjects) had almost a 2-fold increase in CHD risk (OR: 1.94, 95% confidence interval: 1.60 to 2.35) as compared with individuals with GRS ≤5 (30% of diabetic subjects). Prediction of CHD was significantly improved (p < 0.001) when the GRS was added to a model including clinical predictors in the combined samples. Conclusions: Our results illustrate the consistency and differences in the determinants of genetic susceptibility to CHD in diabetic patients and the general populations. {\textcopyright} 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {Comments on an article by J. H. Turner et al. (see record 2013-30668-001). There is growing recognition that the consequences of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on health may reach far beyond the neuropsychiatric sphere. For many years, studies have documented numerous physical health problems in PTSD, and a possible connection between PTSD and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) has received special attention. The study by Turner et al. confirms these previous findings in a sample of patients from outpatient clinics of two Veteran Affairs Medical Centers. In this study, ischemia was assessed by exercise electrocardiography (ECG). Exercise ECG testing is considered less accurate for the assessment of ischemia than stress testing in conjunction with myocardial perfusion imaging, especially because of low specificity and because ST-segment changes during treadmill ECG testing are weak markers of prevalent or incident ischemic heart disease. Despite these limitations, the results are impressively similar to the twin study mentioned earlier, showing about twice the prevalence of ischemia in patients with PTSD compared with those without the disease. Non-ECG measures of exercise treadmill testing-in particular, exercise capacity-have emerged as stronger predictors of cardiovascular risk than ECG measures. It is unfortunate that exercise capacity data from the treadmill tests were not presented in this article because they would have been useful complementary information. The study by Turner et al. provides welcome new evidence of a link between PTSD and CHD. The mechanisms behind this relationship, however, still need to be understood. Clearly, maladaptive behaviors, such as smoking and substance abuse, which are almost invariably more common in persons with PTSD, may be implicated. Lower propensity to seek medical care and poor functioning could translate to reduced self-care or reduced access to health care. In addition to behavioral and lifestyle factors, however, it has long been suggested that neurobiological features characteristic of PTSD could have potential damaging effects on the cardiovascular system.

abstract = {Elderly healthy individuals have a reduced exercise tolerance and a decreased left ventricle inotropic reserve related to increased vascular afterload, arterial-ventricular load mismatching, physical deconditioning and impaired autonomic regulation (the so called "$\beta$-adrenergic desensitization"). Adrenergic responsiveness is altered with aging and the age-related changes are limited to the $\beta$-adrenergic receptor density reduction and to the $\beta$-adrenoceptor-G-protein(s)-adenylyl cyclase system abnormalities, while the type and level of abnormalities change with species and tissues. Epidemiological studies have shown an high incidence and prevalence of heart failure in the elderly and a great body of evidence correlate the changes of $\beta$-adrenergic system with heart failure pathogenesis. In particular it is well known that: (a) levels of cathecolamines are directly correlated with mortality and functional status in heart failure, (b) $\beta$1-adrenergic receptor subtype is down-regulated in heart failure, (c) heart failure-dependent cardiac adrenergic responsiveness reduction is related to changes in G proteins activity. In this review we focus on the cardiovascular $\beta$-adrenergic changes involvement in the aging process and on similarities and differences between aging heart and heart failure.},

abstract = {Aims: Atrial ganglionated plexi (GP) have been shown to modulate atrial electrophysiology and play an important role in atrial fibrillation initiation and maintenance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of atrial GP stimulation (GPS) on ventricular refractoriness, restitution properties and electrical alternans. Methods: In 12 anesthetized dogs, two multiple electrode catheters were sutured at left and right ventricular free walls for recording. Monophasic action potentials were recorded from six epicardial ventricular sites. Ventricular effective refractory period (ERP), action potential duration (APD) restitution properties and APD alternans were measured at baseline and during GPS. Results: Compared with baseline, GPS significantly prolonged ventricular ERP and APD at all sites and decreased their spatial dispersions (P < 0.05 for all). GPS also significantly flattened ventricular restitution curves and decreased the maximal slope of restitution curves at each site (P < 0.05 for all). APD alternans occurred at shorter pacing cycle length at each site during GPS when compared with baseline (P < 0.05 for all). Conclusions: GPS prolonged ventricular ERP, decreased the slope of restitution curves and delayed APD alternans, indicating that GPS may exert a protective role for ventricular arrhythmias. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {Background Risk prediction in elderly patients is increasingly relevant due to longer life expectancy. Objectives This study sought to examine whether electrocardiographic (ECG) changes provide prognostic information incremental to current risk models and to the conventional risk factors. Methods In all, 6,991 participants from the Copenhagen Heart Study attending an examination at age ≥65 years were included. ECG changes were defined as Q waves, ST-segment depression, T-wave changes, ventricular conduction defects, and left ventricular hypertrophy based on the Minnesota code. The primary endpoint was fatal cardiovascular disease (CVD) event and the secondary was fatal or nonfatal CVD event. In our study, 2,236 fatal CVD and 3,849 fatal or nonfatal CVD events occurred during a median of 11.9 and 9.8 years of follow-up. Results ECG changes were frequently present (30.6%) and associated with conventional risk factors. All ECG changes except 1 univariably predicted both endpoints. Event rates of ECG changes versus no ECG changes were respectively 41.4% versus 27.8% and 64.6% versus 50.8%. When added to existing risk scores, ECG changes independently increased the risk of both endpoints. Fatal CVD events: hazard ratio (HR): 1.33 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.29 to 1.36; p < 0.001) and fatal or nonfatal CVD events: HR: 1.21 (95% CI: 1.19 to 1.24; p < 0.001). When added to conventional risk factors, continuous net reclassification improvement was 42.3% (95% CI: 42.0 to 42.4; p < 0.001) for fatal and 29.2% (95% CI: 28.4 to 29.2; p < 0.001) for fatal or nonfatal events. Categorical net reclassification was 7.1% (95% CI: 6.7 to 9.0; p < 0.001) for fatal and 4.2% (95% CI: 3.5 to 5.6; p < 0.001) for fatal or nonfatal events. Conclusions Simple assessment of the existence of ECG changes improves risk prediction in the general population of persons age ≥65 years.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Major depression is a common problem in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and is associated with an increased risk for cardiac morbidity and mortality. It is not known whether treating depression will improve medical prognosis in patients with CHD. Depression is also associated with elevated heart rate and reduced heart rate variability (HRV), which are known risk factors for cardiac morbidity and mortality that may explain the increased risk associated with depression. The purpose of this study was to determine whether treatment for depression with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is associated with decreased heart rate or increased HRV. METHODS Thirty depressed patients with stable CHD, classified as either mildly or moderately to severely depressed, received up to 16 sessions of CBT. The 24-hour heart rate and HRV were measured in these patients and in 22 medically comparable nondepressed controls before and after treatment of the depressed patients. RESULTS Average heart rate and daytime rMSSD (reflecting mostly parasympathetic activity) improved significantly in the severely depressed patients, but remained unchanged in the mildly depressed and the control patients. However, only rMSSD improved to a level comparable to the control patients. None of the remaining indices of HRV showed improvement. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that treating depression with CBT may reduce heart rate and increase short-term HRV. Thus, CBT may have a beneficial effect on a risk factor for mortality in depressed patients with coronary heart disease. A randomized, controlled study is needed to confirm these findings.},

abstract = {Latex-induced transmural myocardial infarction or epicardial application of phenol interrupts sympathetic fibers innervating myocardium apical to the infarction or to the phenol-painted area. These denervated regions subsequently show supersensitive shortening of effective refractory period (ERP) in response to the infusion of norepinephrine (denervation supersensitivity). The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that such denervation supersensitivity is arrhythmogenic. Ventricular arrhythmias were elicited by programmed ventricular stimulation (PVS) during a control period, during bilateral stimulation of the ansae subclaviae (4 msec pulses, 4 Hz and 3 mA), and during the infusion of norepinephrine (0.5 $\mu$g/kg/min). Study groups consisted of 14 sham-operated dogs, 16 dogs with phenol painted over a diagonal branch, 13 dogs with latex embolization of a diagonal branch that resulted in transmural myocardial infarction, 14 dogs with a one-stage ligation of a diagonal branch producing nontransmural myocardial infarction, and 12 dogs undergoing both phenol painting and one-stage ligation of a diagonal branch. Four to 22 days after the first operation, PVS was performed in anesthetized, open-chest dogs after neural decentralization of the heart. Dogs with phenol painting on the epicardium and dogs in which latex was injected into a diagonal branch showed supersensitive shortening of ERP to infused norepinephrine at apical sites. PVS resulted in ventricular fibrillation more often during stimulation of the ansae subclaviae (p < .001) and infusion of norepinephrine (p < .001) than during the control state in dogs treated with phenol alone. The incidence of ventricular fibrillation was highest in dogs with ligation-induced infarction that received phenol compared with all other groups during control (p < .001), stimulation of the ansae subclaviae (p < .002), and the infusion of norepinephrine (p < .01). Propranolol (0.5 mg/kg or 10 mg iv at maximum) attenuated supersensitive shortening of ERP and decreased the incidence of induction of ventricular fibrillation. We conclude that (1) the canine heart with phenol-induced sympathetic supersensitivity, but without myocardial infarction, is more vulnerable to PVS-induced ventricular fibrillation during the infusion of norepinephrine compared with the control group, (2) the canine heart with latex-induced myocardial infarction shows sympathetic supersensitivity, but is not more vulnerable to PVS-induced ventricular fibrillation during stimulation of the ansae subclaviae and infusion of norepinephrine, (3) phenol-induced sympathetic supersensitivity combined with nontransmural myocardial infarction makes the canine heart more vulnerable to PVS-induced ventricular fibrillation than any of the other study conditions.},

We aimed to quantify the associations of social support, assessed at mid-life, with cognitive function in mid-life and with cognitive decline into late life among African Americans and Caucasians.Methods: data from the community-based, prospective Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort of 15,792 biracial participants were examined for baseline and longitudinal associations of mid-life social support with global cognition at mid-life and with 20-year change in global cognition, respectively, stratified by race. Interactions with sociodemographic and cardiometabolic covariates were additionally explored within each race group. Social support was ascertained using two metrics: interpersonal support and social network.Results: interpersonal support was directly associated with greater global cognition at baseline in both race groups. Social network was directly associated with greater global cognition at baseline among Caucasians and African American females, but it was not significantly associated with global cognition in African American males. Neither mid-life social support measure was associated with 20-year change in global cognition.Conclusions: higher levels of social support were moderately associated with greater multi-dimensional cognitive function at mid-life, but mid-life social support was not associated with temporal change in global cognitive function over 20 years into late life. Prospective studies with time-dependent measures of social support and cognition are needed to better understand the role of social engagement in ageing-related cognitive functioning.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION Rapid firing originating within pulmonary veins (PVs) initiates atrial fibrillation (AF). The following studies were performed to evaluate spontaneous PV firing in patients with AF to distinguish focal versus reentrant mechanisms. METHODS Intracardiac recordings were obtained in 18 patients demonstrating paroxysmal AF. Microelectrode (ME) recordings were obtained from superfused canine PV sleeves (N = 48). RESULTS Spontaneous PV firing (566 +/- 16 bpm; 127 +/- 6 ms cycle length) giving rise to AF (52 episodes) was observed. Tachycardia-pause initiation was present in 132 of 200 episodes of rapid PV firing and 34 of 52 AF episodes. The pause cycle length preceding PV firing was 1,039 +/- 86 ms following tachycardia (420 +/- 40 ms cycle length). The remaining episodes were initiated following a 702 +/- 32 ms pause during sinus rhythm (588 +/- 63 ms). Spontaneous firing recorded with a multipolar mapping catheter did not detect electrical activity bridging the diastolic interval between the initial ectopic and preceding post-pause sinus beat. Tachycardia-pause initiated PV firing (138 +/- 7 ms coupling interval) in patients correlated with tachycardia-pause enhanced isometric force, early afterdepolarization (EAD) amplitude, and triggered firing within canine PVs. Rapid firing (1,172 +/- 134 bpm; 51 +/- 8 ms cycle length) following an abbreviated coupling interval (69 +/- 12 ms) was initiated in 13 of 18 canine PVs following tachycardia-pause pacing during norepinephrine + acetylcholine superfusion. Stimulation selectively activating local autonomic nerve terminals facilitated tachycardia-pause triggered firing in canine PVs (5 of 15 vs 0 of 15; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS The studies demonstrate (1) tachycardia-pause initiation of rapid, short-coupled PV firing in AF patients and (2) tachycardia-pause facilitation of isometric force, EAD formation, and autonomic-dependent triggered firing within canine PVs, suggestive of a common arrhythmia mechanism.},

abstract = {Five days of integrative body-mind training (IBMT) improves attention and self-regulation in comparison with the same amount of relaxation training. This paper explores the underlying mechanisms of this finding. We measured the physiological and brain changes at rest before, during, and after 5 days of IBMT and relaxation training. During and after training, the IBMT group showed significantly better physiological reactions in heart rate, respiratory amplitude and rate, and skin conductance response (SCR) than the relaxation control. Differences in heart rate variability (HRV) and EEG power suggested greater involvement of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in the IBMT group during and after training. Imaging data demonstrated stronger subgenual and adjacent ventral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity in the IBMT group. Frontal midline ACC theta was correlated with high-frequency HRV, suggesting control by the ACC over parasympathetic activity. These results indicate that after 5 days of training, the IBMT group shows better regulation of the ANS by a ventral midfrontal brain system than does the relaxation group. This changed state probably reflects training in the coordination of body and mind given in the IBMT but not in the control group. These results could be useful in the design of further specific interventions.},

abstract = {Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) has been associated with adverse prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), but whether this is a uniform finding across different studies has not been described. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies examining the association between MSIMI and adverse outcome events in patients with stable CAD. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases for English language prospective studies of patients with CAD who underwent standardized mental stress testing to determine presence of MSIMI and were followed up for subsequent cardiac events or total mortality. Our outcomes of interest were CAD recurrence, CAD mortality, or total mortality. A summary effect estimate was derived using a fixed-effects meta-analysis model. Only 5 studies, each with a sample size of <200 patients and fewer than 50 outcome events, met the inclusion criteria. The pooled samples comprised 555 patients with CAD (85% male) and 117 events with a range of follow-up from 35 days to 8.8 years. Pooled analysis showed that MSIMI was associated with a twofold increased risk of a combined end point of cardiac events or total mortality (relative risk 2.24, 95% confidence interval 1.59 to 3.15). No heterogeneity was detected among the studies (Q = 0.39, I2= 0.0%, p = 0.98). In conclusion, although few selected studies have examined the association between MSIMI and adverse events in patients with CAD, all existing investigations point to approximately a doubling of risk. Whether this increased risk is generalizable to the CAD population at large and varies in patient subgroups warrant further investigation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Pharmacologic coronary vasodilation as an adjunct to thallium-201 myocardial perfusion scintigraphy provides an important alternative form of stress that has been increasingly used in patients unable to perform an exercise stress test. Although dipyridamole has traditionally been used for this purpose, there are several compelling reasons why adenosine may be a preferable agent. First, dipyridamole acts by blocking the reuptake and transport of adenosine, which is the effective substance responsible for coronary vasodilation. Second, exogenous adenosine has a very short half-life (<2 seconds), which explains its very short duration of action as well as the brief, self-limiting duration of its side effects. Third, the adenosine infusion is controllable and may be increased or decreased as desired. Fourth, the coronary vasodilation induced by the doses of adenosine we recommend (140 $\mu$g/kg/min) may be more profound than that induced by the standard dipyridamole dose. Our experience to date, with nearly 1,000 patients studied, shows the adenosine thallium-201 test to be practical and well tolerated, with high sensitivity (87%) and specificity (94%) for detecting coronary artery disease. {\textcopyright} 1991 Reed Publishing USA.},

abstract = {Objective. In ankylosing spondylitis (AS), the cervical spine, like other sections of the spine and sacroiliac joints, is vulnerable during the disease process. Atlantoaxial subluxation (AAS) has been studied in connection with AS, but its risk factors and progression have not been clarified. Therefore, this study assessed the prevalence and risk factors of AAS in patients with AS. Methods. A total of 819 patients with AS who fulfilled the modified New York criteria and were examined with a full-flexion lateral view of the cervical spine by radiograph were enrolled from an outpatient clinic. The medical records of the patients were retrospectively reviewed and the anterior atlantodental interval (AADI) in the lateral flexion view of the cervical spine radiograph was investigated by 2 experienced musculoskeletal radiologists. We defined the AAS as an AADI of > 3 mm, and progression of AADI as a progression rate > 0.5 mm/year. Results. AAS was found in 14.1% (116/819) of patients. Progression of AADI occurred in 32.1% (26/81) patients with AAS and 5.0% (16/320) patients without AAS (p < 0.001). The development of AAS was significantly associated with elevated C-reactive protein [CRP; OR 2.19 (1.36-3.53)], peripheral arthritis [OR 2.05 (1.36-3.07)], use of anti-tumor necrosis factor antagonists because of failure of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs/disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs [NSAID/DMARD; OR 2.28 (1.52-3.42)], and uveitis [OR 1.71 (1.13-2.59)]. These factors were adjusted for age, sex, and disease duration by logistic regression analysis. No clear association was found for HLA-B27, seropositivity, or smoking status with AAS. Conclusion. AAS is a frequent complication, and the progression of AADI was more rapid in cases with AAS. The presence of peripheral arthritis, or high disease activity with elevated CRP level or refractory to conventional NSAID/DMARD, independently increased the risk of AAS, suggesting that clinicians should focus on the detection and monitoring of AAS, especially in cases with associated risk factors.

abstract = {Alterations of the baroreceptor-heart rate reflex (baroreflex sensitivity, BRS) contribute to the reciprocal reduction of parasympathetic activity and increase of sympathetic activity that accompany the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, the measurement of the baroreflex is a source of valuable information in the clinical management of cardiac disease patients, particularly in risk stratification. This article briefly recalls the pathophysiological background of baroreflex control, and reviews the most relevant methods that have been developed so far for the measurement of BRS. They include three "classic" methods: (i) the use of vasoactive drugs, particularly the alpha-adrenoreceptor agonist phenylephrine, (ii) the Valsalva maneuver, which produces a natural challenge for the baroreceptors by voluntarily increasing intrathoracic and abdominal pressure through straining, and (iii) the neck chamber technique, which allows a selective activation/deactivation of carotid baroreceptors by application of a negative/positive pressure to the neck region. Two more recent methods based on the analysis of spontaneous oscillations of systolic arterial pressure and RR interval are also reviewed: (i) the sequence method, which analyzes the relationship between increasing/decreasing ramps of blood pressure and related increasing/decreasing changes in RR interval through linear regression, and (ii) spectral methods, which assess the relationship (in terms of gain) between specific oscillatory components of the two signals. The limitations of the coherence criterion for the computation of spectral BRS are discussed, and recent proposals for overcoming them are presented. Most relevant clinical applications of BRS measurement are finally reviewed with particular reference to patients with myocardial infarction and heart failure.},

Although the therapeutic approach of HRVB is promising in various stress-related disorders, it has only been offered on a regular basis in a few mental health treatment settings. AIM To analyse the efficacy of HRV biofeedback as an additional psychophysiological treatment for depression and PTSD. METHOD Systematic review with search terms HRV, biofeedback, PTSD, depression, panic disorder and anxiety disorder. RESULTS Our search of the literature yielded 789 studies. After critical appraisal using the GRADE method, we selected 6 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 4 relevant studies. The RCTs with control groups 'treatment as usual' and muscle relaxation training revealed significant clinical efficacy and better results than codntrol conditions after 4 to 8 weeks training. CONCLUSION Although this systematic review shows the popularity of HRV in literature, it does not indicate that HRVB really has been reviewed systematically. Significant outcomes of this limited number of randomised studies indicate there may be a clinical improvement when HRVB training is integrated into treatment of PTSD and depression, particularly when this integration procedure is combined with psychotherapy. More research needs to be done with larger groups and further efforts are needed to integrate HRVB into treatment of stress-related disorders in psychiatry. Future research also needs to focus on the psychophysiological mechanisms involved.},

abstract = {As the literature on heart rate variability (HRV) continues to burgeon, so too do the challenges faced with comparing results across studies conducted under different recording conditions and analysis options. Two important methodological considerations are (1) what sampling frequency (SF) to use when digitizing the electrocardiogram (ECG), and (2) whether to interpolate an ECG to enhance the accuracy of R-peak detection. Although specific recommendations have been offered on both points, the evidence used to support them can be seen to possess a number of methodological limitations. The present study takes a new and careful look at how SF influences 24 widely used time- and frequency-domain measures of HRV through the use of a Monte Carlo-based analysis of false positive rates (FPRs) associated with two-sample tests on independent sets of healthy subjects. HRV values from the first sample were calculated at 1000 Hz, and HRV values from the second sample were calculated at progressively lower SFs (and either with or without R-peak interpolation). When R-peak interpolation was applied prior to HRV calculation, FPRs for all HRV measures remained very close to 0.05 (i.e. the theoretically expected value), even when the second sample had an SF well below 100 Hz. Without R-peak interpolation, all HRV measures held their expected FPR down to 125 Hz (and far lower, in the case of some measures). These results provide concrete insights into the statistical validity of comparing datasets obtained at (potentially) very different SFs; comparisons which are particularly relevant for the domains of meta-analysis and mobile health.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION Previous studies have suggested that paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) of vagal origin often occurs at night and PAF of sympathetic origin occurs during the daytime; however, autonomic tone after spontaneous termination of PAF has not been determined. The aim of this study was to evaluate by heart rate variability (HRV) analysis the relationship between the time of PAF onset and autonomic tone before and after PAF. METHODS AND RESULTS Twenty-three patients (65 +/- 2 years) who underwent 24-hour ambulatory monitoring, had one or more episodes of PAF (>30 min), and had maintained normal sinus rhythm for >60 min before/after PAF were enrolled in this study. Mean duration of PAF was 6.2 +/- 1.2 hours. HRV parameters were analyzed in a 10-minutes section at 60 minutes, 20 minutes, and immediately before the onset of PAF and after its termination. PAF began at night in 14 patients (group N) and during the daytime in 9 patients (group D). In group N, the high-frequency (HF) component and low-frequency (LF) component showed a significant decrease after PAF; PAF was preceded by a gradual increase in HF and LF. Changes in the LF/HF ratio, however, did not occur before or after PAF. Conversely, group D showed a significant increase in the LF/HF ratio before PAF and a decrease in LF and the LF/HF ratio after PAF, but no changes in HF. These changes in HRV parameters were not influenced by the duration or termination time of PAF. CONCLUSION This study suggests that the autonomic nervous system plays an important role in both the initiation and termination of PAF. Furthermore, the time of PAF onset influences the autonomic tone at the initiation and termination of PAF.},

abstract = {Francis A. Bainbridge demonstrated in 1915 that an infusion of saline or blood into the jugular vein of the anesthetized dog produced tachycardia. His findings after transection of the cardiac autonomic nerve supply and injection of the cholinergic blocking drug atropine demonstrated that the tachycardia was reflex in origin, with the vagus nerves constituting the afferent limb and a withdrawal of vagal tone the primary efferent limb. Subsequent investigators demonstrated that the increase in venous return was detected by stretch receptors in the right and left atria. In the 1980s, it was shown convincingly that the Bainbridge reflex was present in primates, including humans, but that the reflex was much less prominent than in the dog. This difference may be due to a more dominant arterial baroreceptor reflex in humans. A "reverse" Bainbridge reflex has been proposed to explain the decreases in heart rate observed under conditions in which venous return is reduced, such as during spinal and epidural anesthesia, controlled hypotension, and severe hemorrhage. The Bainbridge reflex is invoked throughout the anesthesia literature to describe the effect of changes in venous return on heart rate in patients in the surgical and critical care settings, but a critical analysis of the experimental and clinical evidence is lacking. Our main objectives in this review are to summarize the history of the Bainbridge reflex, to describe its anatomy and physiology, and to discuss the evidence for and against it having an influence on heart rate changes observed clinically.

abstract = {AIMS: Dyx is a new heart rate variability (HRV) density analysis specifically designed to identify patients at high risk for malignant ventricular arrhythmias. The aim of this study was to test if Dyx can improve risk stratification for malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias and to test if the previously identified cut-off can be reproduced. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study included 248 patients from the CARISMA study with ejection fraction ≤40% after an acute myocardial infarction and an analysable 24 h Holter recording. All patients received an implantable cardiac monitor, which was used to diagnose the primary endpoint of near-fatal or fatal ventricular tachyarrhythmias likely preventable by an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), during a period of 2 years. A Dyx ≤ 1.96 was considered abnormal. The secondary endpoint was cardiovascular death. At enrolment 59 patients (24%) had a Dyx ≤ 1.96 and 20 experienced a primary endpoint. A Dyx ≤ 1.96 was associated with a significantly increased risk for malignant arrhythmias [hazards ratio (HR) = 4.36 (1.81–10.52), P = 0.001] and cardiovascular death [HR = 3.47 (1.38–8.74), P = 0.008]. Compared with important clinical risk parameters (age >70 years and QRS > 120 ms), Dyx ≤ 1.96 significantly added predictive value (P = 0.0066). CONCLUSIONS: Dyx was a better predictor of ventricular tachyarrhythmias than the traditional measures of HRV and heart rate turbulence, particularly in the elderly. Dyx might be a useful tool for better selection of ICD candidates in the elderly population, since a normal Dyx in this group was associated with a very low risk for malignant ventricular arrhythmias.

abstract = {AIMS: Increased cardiac sympathetic neuron (SN) activity has been associated with pathologies such as heart failure and hypertrophy, suggesting that cardiac innervation regulates cardiomyocyte trophism. Whether continuous input from the SNs is required for the maintenance of the cardiomyocyte size has not been determined thus far.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: To address the role of cardiac innervation in cardiomyocyte size regulation, we monitored the effect of pharmacological sympathetic denervation in mice on cardiac structure, function, and signalling from 24 h to 30 days in the absence of other pathological stimuli. SN ablation caused an immediate reduction in the cardiomyocyte size with minimal consequences on the resting contractile function. Atrophic remodelling was mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system through FOXO-dependent early induction of the muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases Atrogin-1/MAFbx and MuRF1, which was followed by activation of the autophagy-lysosome system. MuRF1 was found to be determinant in denervation atrophy as remodelling did not develop in denervated MuRF1 knock-out (KO) hearts. These effects were caused by decreased basal stimulation of cardiomyocyte $\beta$2-adrenoceptor (AR), as atrophy was prevented by treatment of denervated mice with the $\beta$2-AR agonist clenbuterol. Consistent with these data, we also observed that $\beta$2-AR KO mice showed cardiac atrophy at rest.\n\nCONCLUSION: Cardiac SNs are strong regulators of the cardiomyocyte size via $\beta$2-AR-dependent repression of proteolysis, demonstrating that the neuro-cardiac axis operates constitutively for the determination of the physiological cardiomyocyte size. These results are of great clinical relevance given the role of $\beta$-AR in cardiovascular diseases and their modulation in therapy.},

abstract = {Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as death within 1 h of symptom onset (witnessed) or within 24 h of being observed alive and symptom free (unwitnessed). It affects more than 3 million people annually worldwide and affects approximately 1/1000 people each year in the USA. Familial studies of syndromes with Mendelian inheritance, candidate genes analyses, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have helped our understanding of the genetics of SCD. We will review the genetics of arrhythmogenic hereditary syndromes with Mendelian inheritance from familial studies with structural heart disease (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy) as well as primary electrical causes (long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and short QT syndrome). In addition, we will review the genetics of intermediate phenotypes for SCD such as coronary artery disease and electrocardiographic variables (QT interval, QRS duration, and RR interval). Finally, we will review rare and common variants that are associated with SCD in the general population and were identified from candidate gene analyses and GWAS. Our understanding of the genetics of SCD will improve by the use of next-generation sequencing/whole-exome sequencing as well as whole-genome sequencing which have the potential to discover unsuspected common and rare genetic variants that might be associated with SCD.},

abstract = {Heart rate (HR) and normalized pulse volume (NPV) are physiological indices that have been used in a diversity of psychological studies. However, measuring these indices often requires laborious processes. We therefore developed a new smartphone program, named iPhysioMeter, that makes it possible to measure beat-by-beat HR and ln NPV using only a smartphone. We examined its accuracy against conventional laboratory measures. Mental stress tasks were used to alter HR and ln NPV in 12 participants. Bland-Altman analyses revealed negligible proportional bias for HR and ln NPV or for their change values, expressed as $\Delta$HR and $\Delta$ln NPV. However, a relatively large fixed bias did emerge for ln NPV, as well as a small one for $\Delta$ln NPV, although both were within the limits of agreement. These findings suggest that iPhysioMeter can yield valid measures of the absolute level of HR and of relative changes in ln NPV.},

abstract = {Background A reduction of complexity of heart beating interval variability that is associated with an increased morbidity and mortality in cardiovascular disease states is thought to derive from the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic neural impulses to the heart. However, rhythmic clocklike behavior intrinsic to pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node (SAN) drives their beating, even in the absence of autonomic neural input. Objective To test how this rhythmic clocklike behavior intrinsic to pacemaker cells interacts with autonomic impulses to the heart beating interval variability in vivo. Methods We analyzed beating interval variability in time and frequency domains and by fractal and entropy analyses: (1) in vivo, when the brain input to the SAN is intact; (2) during autonomic denervation in vivo; (3) in isolated SAN tissue (ie, in which the autonomic neural input is completely absent); (4) in single pacemaker cells isolated from the SAN; and (5) after autonomic receptor stimulation of these cells. Results Spontaneous beating intervals of pacemaker cells residing in the isolated SAN tissue exhibit fractal-like behavior and have lower approximate entropy compared with those in the intact heart. Isolation of pacemaker cells from SAN tissue, however, leads to a loss in the beating interval order and fractal-like behavior. $\beta$-Adrenergic receptor stimulation of isolated pacemaker cells increases intrinsic clock synchronization, decreases their action potential period, and increases system complexity. Conclusions Both the average beating interval in vivo and beating interval complexity are conferred by the combined effects of clock periodicity intrinsic to pacemaker cells and their response to autonomic neural input. {\textcopyright} 2014 Heart Rhythm Society.},

The present work aimed to prospectively explore the effects of depression and anxiety on the 10-year CVD incidence, in relation to other lifestyle determinants, as linking factors in the context of the ATTICA study. Study design/Main outcome measures: The ATTICA study is a population-based, health and nutrition prospective cohort study (2002–2012), during which 853 middle-aged participants without a history of CVD [453 men (aged 45 ± 13 years) and 400 women (aged 44 ± 18 years)], underwent psychological evaluations at enrollment. The latent trait of depression and anxiety combined measure was estimated and referred as “Psychological distress”; path analysis was applied to describe the relationships among the different factors. Results “Psychological distress” was positively associated with the 10-year CVD incidence (adjusted OR per 10 units: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1, 1.7). Three linking pathways were revealed: sedentariness, inflammation and metabolic syndrome. Moreover, “Psychological distress” mediated the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and CVD, with participants of low SES scoring higher on the psychological measure (adjusted linear regression coefficient b: −7.1, 95% CI: −9.7, −4.5). Conclusions Lifestyle and clinical factors seem to link psychological distress with CVD development. Joint psychological assessments should be considered for inclusion in CVD preventive strategies, which should incorporate interventions for interrupting the linking pathways.},

DESIGN: Each subject underwent clinical and cognitive examination, a structural brain imaging study, echocardioDoppler, electrocardiogram (ECG), HRV analysis using 24-hour ECG monitoring, and 24-hour blood pressure monitoring. SETTING: Community population-based sample of patients admitted to an AD center for investigation of cognitive disturbances. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-three subjects with AD, 39 subjects with MCI, and 29 cognitive healthy subjects (controls) matched for demographic characteristics, hypertensive condition, smoking habits, and laboratory parameters were enrolled consecutively. MEASUREMENTS: Clinical and cognitive examination, structural brain imaging study, echocardioDoppler, ECG, HRV analysis using 24-hour ECG monitoring, and 24-hour blood pressure monitoring. RESULTS: QTD and QT corrected dispersion mean values were significantly higher in patients with AD than in patients with MCI and controls and higher in patients with MCI than in controls. HRV time and domain parameters were lower in patients with AD than in patients with MCI and controls. No difference in other cardiovascular measures was found. QTD and HRV were found to be significantly correlated with the degree of cognitive impairment. CONCLUSION: These findings support the presence of a peculiar neuroanatomic dysfunction in patients with AD and MCI that parallels the disease progression. These noninvasive parameters might prove to be powerful predictive tools in the worsening of cognitive function and mortality risk.},

METHODS AND RESULTS The first 2 hours of ambulatory ECG recordings obtained on subjects of the Framingham Heart Study who were free of clinically apparent coronary heart disease or congestive heart failure were reprocessed to assess HRV. Five frequency-domain measures and three time-domain measures were obtained. The associations between HRV measures and the incidence of new cardiac events (angina pectroris, myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease death, or congestive heart failure) were assessed with proportional hazards regression analyses. There were 2501 eligible subjects with a mean age of 53 years. During a mean follow-up of 3.5 years, cardiac events occurred in 58 subjects. After adjustment for age, sex, cigarette smoking, diabetes, left ventricular hypertrophy, and other relevant risk factors, all HRV measures except the ratio of low-frequency to high-frequency power were significantly associated with risk for a cardiac event (P = .0016 to .0496). A one-standard deviation decrement in the standard deviation of total normal RR intervals (natural log transformed) was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.47 for new cardiac events (95% confidence interval of 1.16 to 1.86). CONCLUSIONS The estimation of HRV by ambulatory monitoring offers prognostic information beyond that provided by the evaluation of traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors.},

Although it is clear that central command, the exercise pressor reflex and the arterial baroreflex are all requisite for eliciting appropriate cardiovascular adjustments to exercise, this review will be limited primarily to discussion of central command. Central modulation of the cardiovascular system via descending signals from higher brain centres has been well recognized for over a century, yet the specific regions of the human brain involved in this exercise-related response have remained speculative. Brain mapping studies during exercise as well as non-exercise conditions have provided information towards establishing the cerebral cortical structures in the human brain specifically involved in cardiovascular control. The purpose of this review is to provide an update of current concepts on central command in humans, with a particular emphasis on the regions of the brain identified to alter autonomic outflow and result in cardiovascular adjustments.},

Prognostic cohort studies reporting fractal heart rate variability results from 24-h Holter monitor recordings were selected for comparison. Populations were subdivided into four groups—post-myocardial infarction, left ventricular dysfunction, other cardiac, and non-cardiac patients—and analysed using ANOVA, Forest plots (using pooled mean difference), and Funnel plots. The most significant mean differences were recorded in short-term fractal self-similarity ($\alpha$1) (−0.17, 95% CI [−0.21, −0.13], p<0.00001) and the traditional measure called standard deviation of NN intervals (SDNN) (−13.31, 95% CI [−18.89, −7.73], p<0.00001) between the deceased and survivor groups. Fractal measures of long-term fractal self-similarity ($\alpha$2), 1/f scaling ($\beta$), and tradi- tional heart rate variability measures of high frequency to low frequency ratio show promise. This review indicated that fractal measure $\alpha$1 and traditional measure SDNN could be potential predictors of mortality, but require further assessment to determine appropriate thresholds for clinical signifi- cance and additional targeted prognostic studies to properly define their applicability as prognostic markers. Therefore, clinicians should interpret fractal and traditional measures with caution since such measures have yet to be fully described as biomarkers for clinical application.},

abstract = {Background Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is associated with adverse prognosis in coronary artery disease patients. Anger is thought to be a trigger of acute coronary syndromes and is associated with increased cardiovascular risk; however, little direct evidence exists for a link between anger and myocardial ischemia. Methods [99mTc]-sestamibi single-photon emission tomography was performed at rest, after mental stress (a social stressor with a speech task) and after exercise/pharmacologic stress. Summed scores of perfusion abnormalities were obtained by observer-independent software. A summed-difference score, the difference between stress and rest scores, was used to quantify myocardial ischemia under both stress conditions. The Spielberger's State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory was used to assess different anger dimensions. Results The mean age was 50 years, 50% were female, and 60% were non-white. After adjusting for demographic factors, smoking, coronary artery disease severity, depressive, and anxiety symptoms, each IQR increment in state-anger score was associated with 0.36 U-adjusted increase in ischemia as measured by the summed-difference score (95% CI 0.14-0.59); the corresponding association for trait anger was 0.95 (95% CI 0.21-1.69). Anger expression scales were not associated with ischemia. None of the anger dimensions was related to ischemia during exercise/pharmacologic stress. Conclusion Anger, both as an emotional state and as a personality trait, is significantly associated with propensity to develop myocardial ischemia during mental stress but not during exercise/pharmacologic stress. Patients with this psychologic profile may be at increased risk for silent ischemia induced by emotional stress, and this may translate into worse prognosis. (Am Heart J 2015;169:115-121.e2.).},

abstract = {Ventricular arrhythmias generally result in a decrease in arterial pressure and increases in atrial and ventricular filling pressures which would be expected to induce reflex changes in efferent sympathetic nerve activity to the heart and peripheral circulation. Experiments were performed in 14 anesthetized dogs in order to 1) determine whether programmed ventricular stimulation produces changes in renal sympathetic nerve activity; 2) quantitate these changes; and 3) determine the cardiovascular reflexes that mediate these changes. Arterial and right atrial pressures and renal sympathetic nerve activity were recorded in dogs before and after administration of single and double programmed ventricular stimuli. In a group of 10 dogs after single extrastimuli, diastolic arterial pressure decreased by 18 ± 2 mm Hg (mean ± SEM) while renal sympathetic nerve activity increased by 39 ± 15 impulses/s. These changes were directly related to degree of stimulus prematurity. After double extrastimuli, diastolic arterial pressure decreased by 22 ± 2 mm Hg whereas renal sympathetic activity increased by 55 ± 8 impulses/s. In an additional four dogs, double extrastimuli decreased arterial pressure (−34 ± 1 mm Hg) and increased cardiac (86 ± 16%) and renal (82 ± 12%) sympathetic traffic. After si-noaortic denervation, neither single nor double programmed ventricular stimuli resulted in alterations in cardiac or renal sympathetic nerve activity. It is concluded that the decreased arterial pressure caused by single and double programmed ventricular stimuli leads to increases in cardiac and renal sympathetic nerve activity that are mediated by sinoaortic baroreflexes. {\textcopyright} 1987, American College of Cardiology.

abstract = {Objectives The purpose of this study was to investigate the independent association between global cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in addition to regional associations of LV dysinnervation and function, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Background CAN represents a potential mechanism in the etiology of nonischemic diabetic cardiomyopathy. Methods Clinical measures of CAN based on total spectral power of heart rate variability and cardiac reflex testing and echocardiographic assessment of LV function were performed in 118 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Systolic and diastolic function were defined at rest and peak exercise using peak systolic and peak early diastolic (Em) tissue velocities, calculated in 6 basal- and mid-segments using color tissue Doppler. Iodine 123-metaiodobenzylguanidine imaging was performed in 33 patients to directly quantify global (heart/mediastinum ratio) and regional LV sympathetic integrity. Results Patients with CAN demonstrated higher resting heart rate, systolic and mean blood pressures, aortic stiffness, hemoglobin A1c, and urine albumin/creatinine ratio, in addition to lower peak heart rate, chronotropic index, and exercise capacity. Diastolic function (Em) was associated with CAN, evidenced by total spectral power (r = 0.42, p < 0.001) and heart/mediastinum ratio (r = 0.41, p = 0.017). Diastolic function (Em) at rest and systolic function (peak systolic tissue velocity) at rest and exercise were significantly reduced in patients with CAN. Furthermore, total spectral power was associated with Em independent of age, hypertension, metabolic factors, and other relevant contributors to LV dysfunction ($\beta$ = 0.20, p = 0.035). Relative regional tracer deficits indicative of local denervation were predominant in the anterior and lateral walls (p < 0.001). Associations with regional Em, independent of global iodine 123-metaiodobenzylguanidine uptake, were identified exclusively in mid-anterior ($\beta$ = 0.45, p = 0.01) and mid-lateral walls ($\beta$ = 0.34, p = 0.03). However, no association was found between regional denervation and systolic or diastolic dyssynchrony. Conclusions The diastolic dysfunction of type 2 diabetes mellitus shows associations with both regional markers of sympathetic integrity and clinical markers of autonomic neuropathy. {\textcopyright} 2010 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {Concomitant with the development of surgical treatment of cardiac arrythmias and management of myocardial ischemia, there is renewed interest in morphology of the intrinsic cardiac nervous system. In this study, we analyze the topography and structure of the human epicardiac neural plexus (ENP) as a system of seven ganglionated subplexuses. The morphology of the ENP was revealed by a histochemical method for acetylcholinesterase in whole hearts of 21 humans and examined by stereoscopic, contact, and bright-field microscopy. According to criteria established to distinguish ganglionated subplexuses, they are epicardiac extensions of mediastinal nerves entering the heart through discrete sites of the heart hilum and proceeding separately into regions of innervation by seven pathways, on the courses of which epicardiac ganglia, as wide ganglionated fields, are plentifully located. It was established that topography of epicardiac subplexuses was consistent from heart to heart. In general, the human right atrium was innervated by two subplexuses, the left atrium by three, the right ventricle by one, and the left ventricle by three subplexuses. The highest density of epicardiac ganglia was identified near the heart hilum, especially on the dorsal and dorsolateral surfaces of the left atrium, where up to 50% of all cardiac ganglia were located. The number of epicardiac ganglia identified for the human hearts in this study ranged from 706 up to 1,560 and was not correlated with age in most heart regions. The human heart contained on average 836 +/- 76 epicardiac ganglia. The structural organization of ganglia and nerves within subplexuses was observed to vary considerably from heart to heart and in relation to age. The number of neurons identified for any epicardiac ganglion was significantly fewer in aged human compared with infants. By estimating the number of neurons within epicardiac ganglia and relating this to the number of ganglia in the human epicardium, it was calculated that approximately 43,000 intrinsic neurons might be present in the ENP in adult hearts and 94,000 neurons in young hearts (fetuses, neonates, and children). In conclusion, this study demonstrates the total ENP in humans using staining for acetylcholinesterase, and provides a morphological framework for an understanding of how intrinsic ganglia and nerves are structurally organized within the human heart.},

abstract = {Despite improvements in the therapy of underlying heart disease, sudden cardiac death is a major cause of death worldwide. Disturbed Na and Ca handling is known to be a major predisposing factor for life-threatening tachyarrhythmias. In cardiomyocytes, many ion channels and transporters, including voltage-gated Na and Ca channels, cardiac ryanodine receptors, Na/Ca-exchanger, and SR Ca-ATPase are involved in this regulation. We have learned a lot about the pathophysiological relevance of disturbed ion channel function from monogenetic disorders. Changes in the gating of a single ion channel and the activity of an ion pump suffice to dramatically increase the propensity for arrhythmias even in structurally normal hearts. Nevertheless, patients with heart failure with acquired dysfunction in many ion channels and transporters exhibit profound dysregulation of Na and Ca handling and Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and are especially prone to arrhythmias. A deeper understanding of the underlying arrhythmic principles is mandatory if we are to improve their outcome. This review addresses basic tachyarrhythmic mechanisms, the underlying ionic mechanisms and the consequences for ion homeostasis, and the situation in complex diseases like heart failure.},

abstract = {Cognitive impairment is prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), but its underlying mechanisms are obscure. Here, we test the hypothesis that exaggerated orthostatic blood pressure reduction mediates the effects of renal failure on global cognition and memory. A total of 160 study subjects were recruited, including 80 dialysis patients and 80 controls. Global cognition was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and episodic memory was evaluated using the auditory verbal learning test (AVLT). Autonomic function was evaluated via the low-frequency to high-frequency ratio (LF/HF) through heart rate variability analysis. Compared with the controls, the dialysis patients had significantly lower MoCA and AVLT scores (including learning memory, short recall memory, and delayed recall memory) (all p < 0.001). They also showed exaggerated orthostatic systolic blood pressure reductions (all p ≤ 0.001). The maximum orthostatic systolic blood pressure reduction was independently and negatively associated with short ($\beta$ = -0.05, p = 0.029) and delayed ($\beta$ = -0.05, p = 0.035) recall memory in dialysis patients but not in controls. Mediation analysis demonstrated that maximum orthostatic systolic blood pressure reduction mediates 13.8% of the effect of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on short recall memory (p = 0.04). After adjustment for LF/HF, the negative association between maximum orthostatic blood pressure reduction and short recall score remained significant (p = 0.049), while the association between maximum orthostatic blood pressure reduction and delayed recall score became nonsignificant, with a marginal p value of 0.062. Our study reveals that exaggerated orthostatic blood pressure reduction is a possible explanation for ESRD-associated memory deficits.},

abstract = {AIMS Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is typically provoked by negative stressors such as grief, anger, or fear leading to the popular term 'broken heart syndrome'. However, the role of positive emotions triggering TTS remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to analyse the prevalence and characteristics of patients with TTS following pleasant events, which are distinct from the stressful or undesirable episodes commonly triggering TTS. METHODS AND RESULTS Takotsubo syndrome patients with preceding pleasant events were compared to those with negative emotional triggers from the International Takotsubo Registry. Of 1750 TTS patients, we identified a total of 485 with a definite emotional trigger. Of these, 4.1% (n = 20) presented with pleasant preceding events and 95.9% (n = 465) with unequivocal negative emotional events associated with TTS. Interestingly, clinical presentation of patients with 'happy heart syndrome' was similar to those with the 'broken heart syndrome' including symptoms such as chest pain [89.5% (17/19) vs. 90.2% (412/457), P = 1.0]. Similarly, electrocardiographic parameters, laboratory findings, and 1-year outcome did not differ. However, in a post hoc analysis, a disproportionate higher prevalence of midventricular involvement was noted in 'happy hearts' compared with 'broken hearts' (35.0 vs. 16.3%, P = 0.030). CONCLUSION Our data illustrate that TTS can be triggered by not only negative but also positive life events. While patient characteristics were similar between groups, the midventricular TTS type was more prevalent among the 'happy hearts' than among the 'broken hearts'. Presumably, despite their distinct nature, happy and sad life events may share similar final common emotional pathways, which can ultimately trigger TTS.},

abstract = {Background: Depression is associated with an increased risk for cardiac morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). Cardiac autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysregulation, proinflammatory processes, and procoagulant processes have been suggested as possible explanations. Methods: Heart rate variability (HRV), an indicator of cardiac autonomic regulation, and markers of inflammation [C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$)] and coagulation (fibrinogen) were assessed in 44 depressed patients with CHD. Results: Moderate, negative correlations were found between fibrinogen and four measures of HRV. IL-6 also negatively correlated with one measure of HRV (total power) and was marginally related to two others (very low frequency and low frequency power). Neither CRP nor TNF-$\alpha$ was significantly related to any measure of HRV. Conclusions: The finding that fibrinogen and IL-6 are moderately related to HRV suggests a link between these factors in depressed CHD patients. The relationship between ANS function and inflammatory and coagulant processes should be investigated in larger mechanistic studies of depression and cardiac morbidity and mortality. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Background: The ganglionated plexi (GP) located at the junction of the superior vena cava, aorta, and right pulmonary artery (SVC-Ao GP) was proposed to be the head station between the extrinsic and the intrinsic cardiac autonomic nervous system (ECANS and ICANS, respectively). Objective: To investigate the chronic effects after interrupting the ECANS-ICANS connections by ablating the SVC-Ao GP. Methods: A right thoracotomy in 10 dogs allowed stimulation at the right superior and inferior pulmonary veins (RSPV and RIPV, respectively), right atrial appendage (RAA), and SVC to determine effective refractory period (ERP) and atrial fibrillation (AF) inducibility in the first operation. Group 1 (n = 5) received SVC-Ao GP ablation; group 2 (n = 5) received no ablation. A second operation and the same measurements were made 10 weeks later. A pacemaker with lead implanted at the RSPV recorded atrial fibrillation or tachycardia (AF/AT). Results: During the first operation in group 1, ERPs increased significantly in the SVC but not at the RSPV, RIPV, or RAA site immediately after ablation, whereas ERPs decreased significantly in the RSPV, RIPV, and RAA but not the SVC in the second operation performed 10 weeks later (compared to the ERP in the first operation). ERPs decreased and AF/AT burden increased significantly from weeks 4 and 5, respectively, after the first operation in group 1 dogs. The ERP and AF/AT burden in group 2 remained unchanged between operations. Conclusions: Ablation of the head station GP between the ECANS and the ICANS prolonged the ERP acutely, but shortened regional ERPs and increased AF/AT burden chronically, suggesting that the ECANS may tonically inhibit the ICANS activity. {\textcopyright} 2013 Heart Rhythm Society.},

abstract = {Objective Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is characterised by persistent fatigue, exhaustion, and several physical complaints. Research has shown cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and graded exercise training (GET) to be the most effective treatments. In a first step we aimed to assess the efficacy of heart rate variability biofeedback therapy (HRV-BF) as a treatment method comprising cognitive and behavioural strategies and GET in the pilot trial. In a second step we aimed to compare both interventions with regard to specific parameters. Methods The study was conducted in an outpatient treatment setting. A total of 28 women with CFS (50.3 ± 9.3 years) were randomly assigned to receive either eight sessions of HRV-BF or GET. The primary outcome was fatigue severity. Secondary outcomes were mental and physical quality of life and depression. Data were collected before and after the intervention as well as at a 5-month follow-up. Results General fatigue improved significantly after both HRV-BF and GET. Specific cognitive components of fatigue, mental quality of life, and depression improved significantly after HRV-BF only. Physical quality of life improved significantly after GET. There were significant differences between groups regarding mental quality of life and depression favouring HRV-BF. Conclusion Both interventions reduce fatigue. HRV-BF seems to have additional effects on components of mental health, including depression, whereas GET seems to emphasise components of physical health. These data offer implications for further research on combining HRV-BF and GET in patients with CFS. Trial registration The described trial has been registered at the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform following the number DRKS00005445.},

abstract = {AIM To investigate whether uncomplicated chronic coronary artery disease causes changes in heart rate variability and if so, whether the heart rate variability pattern is different from that described in patients with acute myocardial infarction. METHODS Heart rate variability was studied in 65 patients with angina who had no previous myocardial infarcts, no other diseases, and were on no drug that could influence the sinus node. Results were compared with 33 age matched healthy subjects. The diagnosis of coronary artery disease in angina patients was established by coronary angiography in 58, by thallium scintigraphy in six, and by exercise test only in one. Patients and controls were Holter monitored 24 hours outside hospital, and heart rate variability was calculated in the frequency domain as global power (GP: 0.01-1.00 Hz), low frequency peak (LF: 0. 04-0.15 Hz), high frequency peak (HF: 0.15-0.40 Hz), LF/HF in ms(2), and in the time domain as SDNN (SD of normal RR intervals), SDANN (SD of all five minute mean normal RR intervals), SD (mean of all five minute SDs of mean RR intervals), rMSSD (root mean square of differences of successive normal RR intervals) (all in ms), and pNN50 (proportion of adjacent normal RR intervals differing more than 50 ms from the preceding RR interval) as per cent. RESULTS The mean age in patients and controls was 60.4 (range 32-81) and 59.1 (32-77) years, respectively (NS), the male/female ratio, 57/65 and 24/33 (NS), and the mean time of Holter monitoring, 23.0 (18-24) and 22.8 (18-24) hours (NS). Mortality in angina patients was 0% (0/65) at one year, 0% (0/56) at two years, and 3% (1/33) at three years. Compared with healthy subjects angina patients showed a reduction in GP (p = 0.007), HF (p = 0.02), LF (p = 0.02), SD (p = 0.02), rMSSD (p = 0.01), and pNN50 (p = 0.01). No significant difference was found in RR, LF/HF, SDNN, or SDANN. CONCLUSIONS Uncomplicated coronary artery disease without previous acute myocardial infarction was associated with reduced high and low frequency heart rate variability, including vagal tone. SDANN and SDNN, expressing ultra low and very low frequencies which are known to reflect prognosis after acute myocardial infarction, were less affected. This is in agreement with the good prognosis in uncomplicated angina in this study.},

abstract = {A high degree of heart rate (HR) variability is found in compensated hearts with good function, whereas HR variability can be decreased with severe coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, aging and diabetic neuropathy. To test the hypothesis that HR variability is a predictor of long-term survival after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the Holter tapes of 808 patients who survived AMI were analyzed. Heart rate variability was defined as the standard deviation of all normal RR intervals in a 24-hour continuous electrocardiogram recording made 11 ± 3 days after AMI. In all patients demographic, clinical and laboratory variables were measured at baseline. Mean follow-up time was 31 months. Of all Holter variables measured, HR variability had the strongest univariate correlation with mortality. The relative risk of mortality was 5.3 times higher in the group with HR variability of less than 50 ms than the group with HR variability of more than 100 ms. HR variability remained a significant predictor of mortality after adjusting for clinical, demographic, other Holter features and ejection fraction. A hypothesis to explain this finding is that decreased HR variability correlates with increased sympathetic or decreased vagal tone, which may predispose to ventricular fibrillation. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

abstract = {Background: Many traditional risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) are associated with altered autonomic function. Inflammation may provide a link between risk factors, autonomic dysfunction, and CAD. We examined the association between heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function, and inflammation, measured by C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Methods: We examined 264 middle-aged male twins free of symptomatic CAD. All underwent ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring and 24-hour ultra low, very low, low, and high-frequency power were calculated using power spectral analysis. C-reactive protein and IL-6 were measured, and risk factors including age, smoking, hypertension, lipids, diabetes, body mass index (BMI), depression, and physical activity were assessed. Results: Physical activity, BMI, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, depression, and hypertension were directly associated with CRP and IL-6 and inversely associated with one or more HRV variables. There was a graded inverse relationship between all HRV parameters (except high frequency) and CRP and IL-6. After adjustment for age, BMI, activity, high-density lipoprotein, smoking, hypertension, depression, and diabetes, ultra low frequency and very low frequency remained significant predictors of CRP (P < .01). Conclusions: C-reactive protein is associated with decreased HRV, even after controlling for traditional CAD risk factors. Autonomic dysregulation leading to inflammation may represent one pathway through which traditional risk factors promote development of CAD. {\textcopyright} 2008 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The effect of posterior hypothalamic stimulation on cardiac susceptibility to ventricular fibrillation (VF) was studied in 34 dogs. VF threshold was determined by inducing a sequence of early extrasystoles (R/T pulsing). Hypothalamic stimulation was associated with sinus tachycardia, systemic hypertension, and a 40% reduction in VF threshold. The effects of hypothalamic stimulation on the VF threshold persisted when heart rate acceleration and the pressor response were prevented. Cervical vagotomy and bilateral adrenalectomy were likewise without effect on fibrillation threshold changes. However, the decrease in threshold was abolished by beta adrenergic blockade. It is concluded that the reduction in VF threshold associated with hypothalamic stimulation derives from the direct action of sympathetic nerves upon the myocardium, rather than from secondary hemodynamic effects.},

abstract = {Objective: The association between cardiovascular reactivity and major depressive disorder (MDD) remains unclear. This study aimed to examine this association via reactive heart rate variability (HRV) in a well-diagnosed first-episode MDD group and a control group. Methods: A total of 160 physically healthy, drug-naive patients presenting with their first-episode MDD and 50 healthy controls were recruited. All participants underwent a 5-min electrocardiography at rest and during a mental arithmetic task. Depression severity was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI). Results: HRV measures that showed between-group differences at rest did not reached significance during mental stress. In contrast, HRV measures that revealed between-group differences during stress did not reach significance at rest. In response to mental stress, HRV measures did not significantly change in both group. However, LF and HF in response to stress were different between groups. Patients with MDD revealed an increasing trend in HF and a decreasing trend in LF; conversely, healthy controls had a decreasing trend in HF and an increasing trend in LF. BDI scores correlated with changes in heart rate in the control group. Conclusions: The fundamental change to reactive HRV in patients with first-episode MDD appears qualitative, not quantitative. A distinctly reverse trend in reactive HRV measures were evident between these two groups. Moreover, patients with MDD showed entirely distinct changes in reactive HRV from those in resting HRV. We suggest that in patients with MDD, autonomic system shifts to sympathetic dominance at rest but toward parasympathetic dominance in response to stress. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine in a nonclinical sample of preadolescents the possibility that somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms are differentially related with the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Depression is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Dysregulation of the ANS and the HPA axis have been proposed as underlying mechanisms. Several studies suggest that only a subset of the depression symptoms account for associations with cardiovascular prognosis. METHODS: Self-reported somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms were examined in relationship to heart rate variability (HRV), spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), and the cortisol awakening response (CAR) in 2049 preadolescents (mean age = 11.1 years; 50.7% = girls) from the Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS). RESULTS: Physiological measurements were not associated with the overall measure of depressive symptoms. Somatic depressive symptoms were negatively related to HRV and BRS, and positively to the CAR; cognitive-affective depressive symptoms were positively related to HRV and BRS, and negatively to the CAR. Associations with the CAR pertained to boys only. CONCLUSIONS: Somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms differ in their association with both cardiac autonomic and HPA axis function in preadolescents. Particularly, somatic depression symptoms may mark cardiac risk.},

abstract = {Background: Atrial ectopic discharges originating in the pulmonary veins (PVs) are known to initiate atrial fibrillation (AF), which may be terminated by catheter-based PV isolation. Because a functional relationship exists between cardiac autonomic effects and PVs in arrhythmogenesis, it has been suggested that discharges of the nerves that proceed to the PVs and interconnect with intrinsic ganglionated nerve plexuses are potential triggers of AF in man. Objective: This study sought to determine the characteristics and distribution of neural routes by which autonomic nerves supply the human PVs. Methods: We examined the intrinsic neural structures of 35 intact (nonsectioned) left atrial (LA)-PV complexes stained transmurally for acetylcholinesterase using a stereomicroscope. Results: The epicardial ganglionated nerves pass onto the extrapulmonary segments of the human PVs from the middle, left dorsal, and dorsal right atrial subplexuses. The left and right inferior PVs involved a lesser number of ganglia than the left and right superior PVs. Abundant extensions of epicardial nerves penetrate transmurally the PV walls and form a patchy neural network beneath the endothelium of PVs. The subendothelial neural meshwork with numerous free nerve endings, which appeared to be typical sensory compact nerve endings, was mostly situated at the roots of the 4 PVs. No ganglia were identified beneath the endothelium of the human PVs. Conclusion: The richest areas containing epicardial ganglia, from which intrinsic nerves extend to the human PVs, are concentrated at the inferior surface of both the inferior and left superior PVs. Therefore, these locations might be considered as potential targets for focal pulmonary vein ablation in catheter-based therapy of AF. {\textcopyright} 2009 Heart Rhythm Society.},

abstract = {How do adverse childhood experiences get 'under the skin' and influence health outcomes through the life-course? Research reviewed here suggests that adverse childhood experiences are associated with changes in biological systems responsible for maintaining physiological stability through environmental changes, or allostasis. Children exposed to maltreatment showed smaller volume of the prefrontal cortex, greater activation of the HPA axis, and elevation in inflammation levels compared to non-maltreated children. Adults with a history of childhood maltreatment showed smaller volume of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, greater activation of the HPA axis, and elevation in inflammation levels compared to non-maltreated individuals. Despite the clear limitations in making longitudinal claims from cross-sectional studies, work so far suggests that adverse childhood experiences are associated with enduring changes in the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems. These changes are already observable in childhood years and remain apparent in adult life. Adverse childhood experiences induce significant biological changes in children (biological embedding), modifying the maturation and the operating balance of allostatic systems. Their chronic activation can lead to progressive wear and tear, or allostatic load and overload, and, thus, can exert long-term effects on biological aging and health. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The study aim was to determine observational differences in costs of care by the coronary disease diagnostic test modality. BACKGROUND: A number of diagnostic strategies are available with few data to compare the cost implications of the initial test choice. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 11,372 consecutive stable angina patients who were referred for stress myocardial perfusion tomography or cardiac catheterization. Stress imaging patients were matched by their pretest clinical risk of coronary disease to a series of patients referred to cardiac catheterization. Composite 3-year costs of care were compared for two patients management strategies: 1) direct cardiac catheterization (aggressive) and 2) initial stress myocardial perfusion tomography and selective catheterization of high risk patients (conservative). Analysis of variance techniques were used to compare costs, adjusting for treatment propensity and pretest risk. RESULTS: Observational comparisons of aggressive as compared with conservative testing strategies reveal that costs of care were higher for direct cardiac catheterization in all clinical risk subsets (range: $2,878 to $4,579), as compared with stress myocardial perfusion imaging plus selective catheterization (range: $2,387 to $3,010, p < 0.0001). Coronary revascularization rates were higher for low, intermediate and high risk direct catheterization patients as compared with the initial stress perfusion imaging cohort (13% to 50%, p < 0.0001); cardiac death or myocardial infarction rates were similar (p > 0.20). CONCLUSIONS: Observational assessments reveal that stable chest pain patients who undergo a more aggressive diagnostic strategy have higher diagnostic costs and greater rates of intervention and follow-up costs. Cost differences may reflect a diminished necessity for resource consumption for patients with normal test results.},

abstract = {Background Although recent studies suggest that measuring coronary artery calcification (CAC) may be superior to indirect atherosclerotic markers in predicting cardiac risk, there are limited data evaluating imaging-based biomarkers that directly quantify atherosclerosis in different vascular beds performed in a single cohort. Objectives The BioImage Study (A Clinical Study of Burden of Atherosclerotic Disease in an At-Risk Population) sought to identify imaging biomarkers that predict near-term (3-year) atherothrombotic events. Methods The BioImage Study enrolled 5,808 asymptomatic U.S. adults (mean age: 69 years, 56.5% female) in a prospective cohort evaluating the role of vascular imaging on cardiovascular risk prediction. All patients were evaluated by CAC and novel 3-dimensional carotid ultrasound. Plaque areas from both carotid arteries were summed as the carotid plaque burden (cPB). The primary endpoint was the composite of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke). A broader secondary MACE endpoint also included all-cause death, unstable angina, and coronary revascularization. Results Over a median follow-up of 2.7 years, MACE occurred in 216 patients (4.2%), of which 82 (1.5%) were primary events. After adjustment for risk factors, and compared with individuals without any cPB, hazard ratios for MACE were 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.31 to 1.91), 1.45 (95% CI: 0.67 to 3.14), and 2.36 (95% CI: 1.13 to 4.92) with increasing cPB tertile, with similar results for CAC. Net reclassification significantly improved with either cPB (0.23) or CAC (0.25). MACE rates increased simultaneously with higher levels of both cPB and CAC. Conclusions Detection of subclinical carotid or coronary atherosclerosis improves risk predictions and reclassification compared with conventional risk factors, with comparable results for either modality.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) is a known mediator of bone regeneration and vascular calcification, to date no study has investigated the relationship between BMP-2 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its possible role in coronary artery disease (CAD). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship of BMP-2 with atherosclerosis and calcification in patients with T2DM.\n\nMETHODS: 124 subjects were enrolled in this study: 29 patients with T2DM and CAD; 26 patients with T2DM and without CAD; 36 patients with CAD and without T2DMand 34 without T2DM or CAD (control group). Severity of coronary lesions was assessed using coronary angiography and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Plasma BMP-2 levels were quantified using a commercially available ELISA kit.\n\nRESULTS: Compared to the control group, the mean plasma BMP-2 level was significantly higher in T2DM patients with or without CAD (20.1 ± 1.7 or 19.3 ± 1.5 pg/ml, vs 17.2 ± 3.3 pg/ml, P <0.001). In a multivariable linear regression analysis, both T2DM and CAD were significantly and positively associated with BMP-2 (Estimate, 0.249; standard error (SE), 0.063; p <0.0001; Estimate, 0.400; SE, 0.06; p <0.0001). Plasma BMP-2 was also strongly correlated with glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (Spearman $\rho$ = -0.31; p = 0.0005). SYNTAX score was also significantly associated with BMP-2 (Spearman $\rho$ = 0.46; p = 0.0002). Using the results from IVUS, plasma BMP-2 levels were shown to positively correlate with plaque burden (Spearman $\rho$ = 0.38, P = 0.002) and plaque calcification (Spearman $\rho$ =0.44, P = 0.0003) and to negatively correlate with lumen volume (Spearman $\rho$ =0.31, P = 0.01).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that patients with T2DM had higher circulating levels of BMP-2 than normal controls. Plasma BMP-2 levels correlated positively with plaque burden and calcification in patients with T2DM.},

abstract = {Background: The mechanisms by which psychological factors may influence possibly arrhythmia risk are not known. We hypothesized that psychological wellness, measured by the General Well-Being Schedule (GBWS), is associated with less repolarization heterogeneity as measured by T-axis. We also explored whether T-axis was a mediator in the relationship of GWBS with adverse cardiac outcomes. Methods: We studied 5533 adults aged 25–74 years without a history of CVD from NHANES I (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) (1971–75). Frontal T-axis was obtained through 12-lead ECG and characterized as normal (15° to 75°), borderline (−15° to 15° or 75° to 105°) or abnormal (>105° or <−15°). Results: The mean ± SD age was 43.1 ± 11.5 years and 55% were women. A 1-SD increase in GWBS score associated with a 23% reduced odds of abnormal T-axis (p < 0.001) and 11% lower hazard of composite CHD hospitalization and death (p = 0.02). When adjusting for sociodemographic factors, health behaviors, and CHD risk factors, the association was minimally changed and remained statistically significant. Additional adjustment for T-axis did not change the relationship with outcomes. Conclusion: General well-being is independently associated with less abnormal frontal T-axis and CHD events in otherwise healthy individuals.},

To delineate the distribution of beta-receptor subtypes in myocytic and vascular components of the heart, we incubated transmural sections of canine left ventricle with [125Iodo]cyanopindolol and selected concentrations of the beta 1-selective antagonist betaxolol or the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118,551. Detailed competition binding data were best accounted for by a two-site model in which approximately 75% of total sites were beta 1- and 25% were beta 2-receptors. The relative proportions of beta-receptor subtypes in myocytic and vascular components were assessed autoradiographically by analyzing the density of binding sites in transmural sections incubated with radioligand and subtype-selective displacers. Betaxolol (10(-7) M) reduced the density of radioligand binding sites by 44% in regions composed primarily of ventricular myocytes but by less than 5% in small coronary arterioles. ICI 118,551 (10(-7) M) reduced radioligand binding-site density by 18% in myocytic regions and by 55% in small arterioles. In myocytic regions, these data indicated a subtype composition of approximately 85% beta 1- and 15% beta 2-sites. In contrast, arterioles contained almost exclusively the beta 2-subtype. The diameters of coronary vessels in which beta 2-receptors were found to be selectively increased fell within a narrow range (mean +/- SD, 35 +/- 11 microns; range, 16-55 microns). Small mural arteries and venules did not contain a significantly higher proportion of beta 2-receptors than adjacent myocytic regions.},

Injection of nicotine or veratridine into the Cx consistently resulted in larger decreases in heart rate, arterial pressure, and in gracilis perfusion pressure than were observed following injection of the same dose into the LAD. Vagotomy abolished the cardioinhibitory and vasodepressor responses to intracoronary nicotine or veratridine. The weight of left ventricle perfused by LAD or Cx was not different (43.5 +/- 1.65 and 44.5 +/- 2.2 g, respectively. These data indicate that chemical activation of sensory endings with vagal afferents in the inferoposterior left ventricle of the dog results in larger cardionhibitor and vasodepressor responses than result from activation of respects in the anterior left ventricle. Further, these data provide strong evidence that these sensory endings which are chemically activated are preferentially distributed to the inferoposterior left ventricle.},

abstract = {Measures of heart rate variability (HRV) are widely used to assess autonomic nervous system (ANS) function. The signal from which they are derived requires accurate determination of the interval between successive heartbeats; it can be recorded via electrocardiography (ECG), which is both non-invasive and widely available. However, methodological problems inherent in the recording and analysis of ECG traces have motivated a search for alternatives. Photoplethysmography (PPG) constitutes another means of determining the timing of cardiac cycles via continuous monitoring of changes in blood volume in a portion of the peripheral microvasculature. This technique measures pulse waveforms, which in some instances may prove a practical basis for HRV analysis. We investigated the feasibility of using earlobe PPG to analyse HRV by applying the same analytic process to PPG and ECG recordings made simultaneously. Comparison of 5-minute recordings demonstrated a very high degree of correlation in the temporal and frequency domains and in nonlinear dynamic analyses between HRV measures derived from PPG and ECG. Our results confirm that PPG provides accurate interpulse intervals from which HRV measures can be accurately derived in healthy subjects under ideal conditions, suggesting this technique may prove a practical alternative to ECG for HRV analysis. This finding is of particular relevance to the care of patients suffering from peripheral hyperkinesia or tremor, which make fingertip PPG recording impractical, and following clinical interventions known to introduce electrical artefacts into the electrocardiogram.},

abstract = {The shorter term beat-to-beat heart rate data collected from the general population are often interrupted by artifacts, and an arbitrary exclusion of such individuals from analysis may significantly reduce the sample size and/or introduce selection bias. A computer algorithm was developed to label as artifacts any data points outside the upper and lower limits generated by a 5-beat moving average ±25% (or set manually by an operator using a mouse) and to impute beat-to-beat heart rate throughout an artifact period to preserve the timing relationships of the adjacent, uncorrupted heart rate data. The algorithm applies Fast Fourier Transformation to the smoothed data to estimate low-frequency (LF; 0.025-0.15 Hz) and high-frequency (HF; 0.16-0.35 Hz) spectral powers and the HF/LF ratio as conventional indices of sympathetic, vagal, and vagal-sympathetic balance components, respectively. We applied this algorithm to resting, supine, 2-min beat-to-beat heart rate data collected in the population-based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study to assess the performance (success rate) of the algorithm (N = 526) and the inter- and intra-data-operator repeatability of using this computer algorithm (N = 108). Eighty-eight percent (88%) of the records could be smoothed by the computer-generated limits, an additional 4.8% by manually set limits, and 7.4% of the data could not be processed due to a large number of artifacts in the beginning or the end of the records. For the repeatability study, 108 records were selected at random, and two trained data operators applied this algorithm to the same records twice within a 6-month interval of each process (blinded to each other's results and their own prior results). The inter-data-operator reliability coefficients were 0.86, 0.92, and 0.90 for the HF, LF, and HF/LF components, respectively. The average intra-data-operator reliability coefficients were 0.99, 0.99, and 0.98 for the HF, LF, and HF/LF components, respectively. These results indicate that this computer algorithm is efficient and highly repeatable in processing short-term beat-to-beat heart rate data collected from the general population, given that the data operators are trained according to standardized protocol.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A limitation of stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is the inability to detect non-obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). One advantage of MPI with a hybrid CT device is the ability to obtain same-setting measurement of the coronary artery calcium score (CACS). METHODS AND RESULTS: Utilizing our single-center nuclear database, we identified 760 consecutive patients with: (1) no CAD history; (2) a normal clinically indicated Rb-82 PET/CT stress perfusion study; and (3) a same-setting CAC scan. 487 of 760 patients (64.1%) had subclinical CAD based on an abnormal CACS. Of those with CAC, the CACS was > or =100, > or =400, and > or =1000 in 47.0%, 22.4%, and 8.4% of patients, respectively. Less than half of the patients with CAC were receiving aspirin or statin medications prior to PET/CT imaging. Patients with CAC were more likely to be initiated or optimized on proven medical therapy for CAD immediately following PET/CT MPI compared to those without CAC. CONCLUSIONS: Subclinical CAD is common in patients without known CAD and normal myocardial perfusion assessed by hybrid PET/CT imaging. Identification of CAC influences subsequent physician prescribing patterns such that those with CAC are more likely to be treated with proven medical therapy for the treatment of CAD.},

Experimental evidence for an associ- ation between a propensity for lethal arrhythmias and signs of either increased sympathetic or reduced vagal activity has encouraged the development of quantitative markers of autonomic activity. Heart rate variability (HRV) represents one of the most promising such markers. The apparently easy derivation of this measure has popularized its use. As many commercial devices now provide automated measurement of HRV, the cardiologist has been pro- vided with a seemingly simple tool for both research and clinical studies[5]. However, the significance and meaning of the many different measures of HRV are more complex than generally appreciated and there is a potential for incorrect conclusions and for excessive or unfounded extrapolations.

Co-morbid depression and/or anxiety is prevalent in 20% of patients with cardiovascular disease, which may be either transient or chronic. Distress, such as depression, reduces adherence, serves as a barrier to behaviour change and the adoption of a healthy lifestyle, and increases the risk that patients drop out of cardiac rehabilitation, impacting on patients' quality of life, risk of hospitalisation and mortality. Hence it is paramount to identify this subset of high-risk patients in clinical practice. This review provides a general overview of the prevalence of selected psychosocial risk factors, their impact on patient-reported and clinical outcomes, and bio-logical and behavioural mechanisms that may explain the association between psychosocial factors and health outcomes. The review also provides recommendations on which self-report screening measures to use to identify patients at high risk due to their psychosocial profile, and the effectiveness of available trials that target these risk factors. Despite challenges and barriers associated with screening of patients combined with appropriate treatment, it is paramount that we treat not only the heart but also the mind in order to improve the quality of care and patient and clinical outcomes.},

DESIGN Prospective cohort of patients with chronic regional pain syndrome type I and II of the upper extremity requiring therapeutic stellate ganglion blockade. SETTING University-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS Fifteen adult ASA physical status I and II patients with the diagnosis of chronic regional pain syndrome type I and II of the arm were studied. Right stellate ganglion block was performed in nine subjects and a left in six. INTERVENTIONS Stellate ganglion block was performed with 10 mL of 1% plain Xylocaine. Transthoracic echocardiograms were performed immediately prior and 30 min following the block. MEASUREMENTS Heart rate and blood pressure were monitored at regular intervals. Global systolic function was determined by calculating ejection fraction. Regional systolic motion was evaluated on the short axis and four-chamber views using the American Society of Echocardiography criteria. Diastolic function was assessed with pulsed-wave Doppler of the left ventricular outflow tract and the mitral valve. Data collected included isovolumic relaxation time and early and atrial velocity patterns. MAIN RESULTS A successful stellate ganglion block was achieved in all patients. Blood pressure and heart rate were not significantly different during data collection. Patients who underwent a right stellate ganglion block showed no significant differences in systolic or diastolic function. Following a left stellate ganglion block, global and regional systolic function remained unchanged. Isovolumic relaxation time was increased but did not reach statistical significance (80 +/- 13 ms to 88 +/- 9 ms; p = 0.09). Left ventricular end-diastolic (LVEDV) and end-systolic volumes (LVESV) were significantly increased (LVEDV from 73 +/- 9 mL to 100 +/- 9 mL, p < 0.02; LVESV from 31 +/- 4 mL to 37 +/- 4 mL, p < 0.03). CONCLUSIONS In patients without cardiovascular disease, unilateral denervation of the left ventricle after stellate ganglion block produces no clinical deleterious effects on left ventricular function.},

abstract = { The sympathetic nervous system increases heart rate by activating $\beta$ adrenergic receptors and increasing cAMP levels in myocytes in the sinoatrial node. The molecular basis for this response is not well understood; however, the cardiac funny current (I f ) is thought to be among the end effectors for cAMP signaling in sinoatrial myocytes. I f is produced by hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide–sensitive (HCN4) channels, which can be potentiated by direct binding of cAMP to a conserved cyclic nucleotide binding domain in the C terminus of the channels. $\beta$ adrenergic regulation of I f in the sinoatrial node is thought to occur via this direct binding mechanism, independent of phosphorylation. Here, we have investigated whether the cAMP-activated protein kinase (PKA) can also regulate sinoatrial HCN4 channels. We found that inhibition of PKA significantly reduced the ability of $\beta$ adrenergic agonists to shift the voltage dependence of I f in isolated sinoatrial myocytes from mice. PKA also shifted the voltage dependence of activation to more positive potentials for heterologously expressed HCN4 channels. In vitro phosphorylation assays and mass spectrometry revealed that PKA can directly phosphorylate at least 13 sites on HCN4, including at least three residues in the N terminus and at least 10 in the C terminus. Functional analysis of truncated and alanine-substituted HCN4 channels identified a PKA regulatory site in the distal C terminus of HCN4, which is required for PKA modulation of I f . Collectively, these data show that native and expressed HCN4 channels can be regulated by PKA, and raise the possibility that this mechanism could contribute to sympathetic regulation of heart rate. },

abstract = {Syncope is a clinical syndrome defined as a relatively brief self-limited transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) caused by a period of inadequate cerebral nutrient flow. Most often the trigger is an abrupt drop of systemic blood pressure. True syncope must be distinguished from other common non-syncope conditions in which real or apparent TLOC may occur such as seizures, concussions, or accidental falls. The causes of syncope are diverse, but in most instances, are relatively benign (e.g., reflex and orthostatic faints) with the main risks being accidents and/or injury. However, in some instances, syncope may be due to more worrisome conditions (particularly those associated with cardiac structural disease or channelopathies); in such circumstances, syncope may be an indicator of increased morbidity and mortality risk, including sudden cardiac death (SCD). Establishing an accurate basis for the etiology of syncope is crucial in order to initiate effective therapy. In this review, we focus primarily on the causes of syncope that are associated with increased SCD risk (i.e., sudden arrhythmic cardiac death), and the management of these patients. In addition, we discuss the limitations of our understanding of SCD in relation to syncope, and propose future studies that may ultimately address how to improve outcomes of syncope patients and reduce SCD risk.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) have been established in the last few years as a non-invasive method for recording the demands on the cardiovascular system. The development enables us today to measure the interbeat intervals with different technologies for calculating HR and HRV. MATERIALS AND METHODS This review is based on a systematic literature search in PubMed for validity of different measurement techniques and their pros and cons for the measurement of HR and the analysis of HRV. RESULTS Measurement equipment for recording of interbeat intervals should have a high storage capacity and a sampling rate of 1000 Hz ideally. The quality criteria of freedom of feedback (small, little disruptive), robustness and a non-invasive measurement (e. g. freeze-electrodes or sensors) have to be fulfilled. In addition to the Holter ECG, several portable heart rate watch and chest belt systems provide adequate validity and good applicability. DISCUSSION The Holter ECG is still the gold standard for the measurement of NN intervals and for the analysis of HRV. Modern heart rate watches show a good correlation with the conformance of freedom from discomfort, robustness and non-invasive measurement and are a good alternative due to the lower disturbance of test persons.},

It describes recent human brain imaging studies that relate activity in these brain circuits to emotional processes, peripheral physiology, preclinical pathophysiology, as well as clinical outcomes. Recent Findings Negative emotions and the regulation of negative emotions reliably engage several brain regions that cross-sectional and longitudinal brain imaging studies have associated with CVD risk markers and outcomes. These brain regions include the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and insula. Other studies have applied advanced statistical techniques to characterize multivariate patterns of brain activity and brain connectivity that associate with negative emotion and CVD-relevant peripheral physiology. Summary Brain imaging studies on emotion and cardiovascular disease risk are expanding our understanding of the brain-body bases of psychosocial and behavioral risk for cardiovascular disease.},

@article{Billman2013,
abstract = {Power spectral analysis of the beat-to-beat variations of heart rate or the heart period (R–R interval) has become widely used to quantify cardiac autonomic regulation (Appel et al., 1989; Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Berntson et al., 1997; Denver et al., 2007; Thayler et al., 2010; Billman, 2011). This technique partitions the total variance (the “power”) of a continuous series of beats into its frequency components, typically identifying two or three main peaks: Very Low Frequency (VLF) <0.04 Hz, Low Frequency (LF), 0.04–0.15 Hz, and High Frequency (HF) 0.15–0.4 Hz. It should be noted that the HF peak is shifted to a higher range (typically 0.24–1.04 Hz) in infants and during exercise (Berntson et al., 1997). The HF peak is widely believed to reflect cardiac parasympathetic nerve activity while the LF, although more complex, is often assumed to have a dominant sympathetic component (Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Berntson et al., 1997; Billman, 2011). Based upon these assumptions, Pagani and co-workers proposed that the ratio of LF to HF (LF/HF) could be used to quantify the changing relationship between sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve activities (i.e., the sympatho-vagal balance) (Pagani et al., 1984, 1986; Malliani et al., 1991) in both health and disease. However, this concept has been challenged (Kingwell et al., 1994; Koh et al., 1994; Hopf et al., 1995; Eckberg, 1997; Houle and Billman, 1999; Billman, 2011). Despite serious and largely under-appreciated limitations, the LF/HF ratio has gained wide acceptance as a tool to assess cardiovascular autonomic regulation where increases in LF/HF are assumed to reflect a shift to “sympathetic dominance” and decreases in this index correspond to a “parasympathetic dominance.” Therefore, it is vital to provide a critical assessment of the assumptions upon which this concept is based.},

abstract = {The modern treatment of cardiac arrest is an increasingly complex medical procedure with a rapidly changing array of therapeutic approaches designed to restore life to victims of sudden death. The 2 primary goals of providing artificial circulation and defibrillation to halt ventricular fibrillation remain of paramount importance for saving lives. They have undergone significant improvements in technology and dissemination into the community subsequent to their establishment 60 years ago. The evolution of artificial circulation includes efforts to optimize manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation, external mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation devices designed to augment circulation, and may soon advance further into the rapid deployment of specially designed internal emergency cardiopulmonary bypass devices. The development of defibrillation technologies has progressed from bulky internal defibrillators paddles applied directly to the heart, to manually controlled external defibrillators, to automatic external defibrillators that can now be obtained over-the-counter for widespread use in the community or home. But the modern treatment of cardiac arrest now involves more than merely providing circulation and defibrillation. As suggested by a 3-phase model of treatment, newer approaches targeting patients who have had a more prolonged cardiac arrest include treatment of the metabolic phase of cardiac arrest with therapeutic hypothermia, agents to treat or prevent reperfusion injury, new strategies specifically focused on pulseless electric activity, which is the presenting rhythm in at least one third of cardiac arrests, and aggressive post resuscitation care. There are discoveries at the cellular and molecular level about ischemia and reperfusion pathobiology that may be translated into future new therapies. On the near horizon is the combination of advanced cardiopulmonary bypass plus a cocktail of multiple agents targeted at restoration of normal metabolism and prevention of reperfusion injury, as this holds the promise of restoring life to many patients for whom our current therapies fail.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is set to become a major health problem with the exponential ageing of the world's population. The association between MCI and autonomic dysfunction, supported by indirect evidence and rich with clinical implications in terms of progression to dementia and increased risk of mortality and falls, has never been specifically demonstrated. AIM To conduct a comprehensive assessment of autonomic function in subjects with MCI by means of power spectral analysis (PSA) of heart rate variability (HRV) at rest and during provocative manoeuvres. METHODS This cross-sectional study involved 80 older outpatients (aged ≥ 65) consecutively referred to a geriatric unit and diagnosed with MCI or normal cognition (controls) based on neuropsychological testing. PSA was performed on 5-minute electrocardiographic recordings under three conditions--supine rest with free breathing (baseline), supine rest with paced breathing at 12 breaths/minute (parasympathetic stimulation), and active standing (orthosympathetic stimulation)--with particular focus on the changes from baseline to stimulation of indices of sympathovagal balance: normalized low frequency (LFn) and high frequency (HFn) powers and the LF/HF ratio. Blood pressure (BP) was measured at baseline and during standing. Given its exploratory nature in a clinical population the study included subjects on medications with a potential to affect HRV. RESULTS There were no significant differences in HRV indices between the two groups at baseline. MCI subjects exhibited smaller physiological changes in all three HRV indices during active standing, consistently with a dysfunction of the orthosympathetic system. Systolic BP after 10 minutes of standing was lower in MCI subjects, suggesting dysautonomia-related orthostatic BP dysregulation. CONCLUSIONS Our study is novel in providing evidence of autonomic dysfunction in MCI. This is associated with orthostatic BP dysregulation and the ongoing follow-up of the study population will determine its prognostic relevance as a predictor of adverse health outcomes.},

abstract = {Ovine susceptibility to scrapie is largely controlled by polymorphisms in the PRNP gene. Beginning in 2003, breeding programmes based on the known association between this gene and the susceptibility/resistance status of this disease have been implemented in many European countries. This is not the case in Turkey, where the PRNP gene was not genotyped in native sheep breeds until recently. We sequenced the complete open reading frame of the PRNP gene in 100 sheep belonging to five native Turkish sheep breeds (Akkaraman=21; Morkaraman=20; Tuj=17; Hemsin=23; Karayaka=19). Based on the variability found at codons 136, 154 and 171 (also referred to as standard codons), we determined six alleles VRQ, TRQ, ARR, ARH, ARK and ARQ. The archetype, ARQ, was the most frequent variant in each of the five breeds (across-breed frequency=0.710), while the second most frequent was the resistance-associated ARR allele (0.140). The susceptible VRQ allele exhibited the lowest frequency (0.015). The AHQ allele was not found in any of the analysed breeds. Beyond variability in the standard codons, we found ten additional amino acid variants (M112T, G127S, G127V, M137T, L141F, H143R, N146S, Y172D, Q189L and V213E), one of which, V213E, has not been previously described to our knowledge. Overall, this report may serve as a complement of previous studies on the genetic background of native Turkish sheep regarding the resistance/susceptibility status to classical and atypical scrapie.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prior experimental studies show that thoracic spinal cord stimulation (SCS) improves left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF). The mechanism of this improvement in the LV contractile function after SCS and its effects on the myocardial oxygen consumption remains unknown.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We performed thoracic SCS (T1-T2 level) followed by 4 weeks of rapid ventricular pacing in 9 adult pigs with ischemic heart failure (HF) induced by myocardial infarction (MI). At 24 hours off-pacing, detailed echocardiogram and invasive hemodynamic assessment were performed to determine LV contractile function and myocardial oxygen consumption. Serum norepinephrine level was measured before and after SCS. SCS was performed on 2 occasions for 15 minutes, 30 minutes apart (recovery) with 50 Hz frequency (pulse width 0.2 millisecond, 90% of motor threshold at 2 Hz output). Echocardiogram revealed significant decrease in LVEF (33.8 ± 1.8% vs 66.5 ± 1.7%, P < 0.01) after induction of MI and HF. Compared with MI and HF, acute SCS significantly increased LVEF and +dP/dt (all P < 0.05). Withdrawal of SCS during recovery decreased +dP/dt, but not LVEF that increased again with repeated SCS. Myocardial oxygen consumption also significantly decreased during SCS compared with MI and HF (P = 0.006) without any change in serum norepinephrine level (P = 0.9). Speckle tracking imaging showed significant improvement in global and regional circumferential strains over the infarcted mid and apical regions, decreased in time to peak circumferential strain over the lateral and posterior wall after SCS, and the degree of intraventricular dyssynchrony during SCS compared with MI and HF (P < 0.05).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: In a porcine model of ischemic HF, acute SCS improved global and regional LV contractile function and intraventricular dyssynchrony, and decreased myocardial oxygen consumption without elevation of norepinephrine level.},

abstract = {Drugs that affect the autonomic nervous system can influence the Q-T interval directly or by changing the heart rate. Bazett's formula to correct for rate may be misleading after certain drug interventions. This hypothesis was tested in 20 patients receiving both propranolol (0.15 mg/kg intravenously) and atropine (0.03 mg/kg intravenously). Six patients received propranolol first, 7 patients received atropine first, and 7 patients received atropine plus propranolol simultaneously. During control and after drug intervention, the Q-T interval was measured directly in sinus rhythm and during a fixed atrial paced rate, and was calculated using Bazett's formula. The ventricular effective refractory period was also determined in 6 patients after administration of atropine plus propranolol. The sinus cycle length (836 ± 156 to 648 ± 84 ms, mean ± standard deviation), measured Q-T interval (367 ± 26 to 329 ± 26 ms), and atrially paced Q-T interval (330 ± 28 to 315 ±27 ms) shortened after atropine plus propranolol (p <0.001), but the corrected Q-T interval with use of Bazett's formula did not change (402 ± 33 to 412 ± 24 ms). The ventricular effective refractory period also shortened from 241 to 20 to 218 ± 21 ms after atropine plus propranolol (p <0.02). The sinus cycle length increased after propranolol (750 ± 97 to 907 ± 108 ms, p <0.001), but no change occurred in the measured Q-T interval or atrial paced Q-T interval although the corrected Q-T interval using Bazett's formula was greatly shortened (428 ± 15 to 391 ±22 ms, p <0.001). The sinus cycle length, measured Q-T interval, and atrially paced Q-T interval decreased after atropine (p <0.01), but the corrected Q-T interval lengthened (375 ± 29 to 418 ± 28 ms, p <0.01). In summary, atropine and atropine plus propranolol shorten the Q-T interval independent of rate, demonstrating a direct vagal effect on the Q-T interval.

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Low heart rate variability (HRV), a marker of cardiac autonomic dysfunction, has been associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. We examined the association between reduced HRV and incident stroke in a community-based cohort. METHODS The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study measured HRV using 2-minute ECG readings in 12 550 middle-aged adults at baseline (1987-1989). HRV indices were calculated using the SD of RR intervals (SDNN), the mean of all normal RR intervals (meanNN), the root mean square of successive differences of successive RR intervals (RMSSD), low (LF) and high (HF) frequency power, and the LF/HF ratio. All HRV measures were categorized into quintiles. Incident stroke was adjudicated through 2011. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with the lowest HRV quintile as the reference, with and without stratification by prevalent diabetes mellitus. RESULTS Over a median follow-up of 22 years, 816 (6.5%) participants experienced incident stroke. After covariate adjustment, there was no strong evidence of association between HRV and stroke risk. In stratified analyses, the lowest HRV quintile was associated with higher stroke risk compared with the highest quintile for SDNN (HR, 2.0, 95% confidence interval, 1.1-4.0), RMSSD (HR, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.9-3.2), LF (HR, 1.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.8-3.0), and HF (HR, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.9-3.0) only among people with diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSIONS Lower HRV was associated with higher risk of incident stroke among middle-aged adults with prevalent diabetes mellitus but not among people without diabetes mellitus.},

abstract = {Cardiac sympathetic denervation for intractable angina pectoris in patients unsuitable for conventional revascularization is currently gaining popularity since this procedure may be performed via minimally invasive surgery. A thorough understanding of cardiac innervation and its variations is crucial to successfully effect cardiac denervation. This study aimed to demonstrate the cervical and thoracic sympathetic contributions to the cardiac plexus. The cervical and thoracic sympathetic trunks in 21 fetuses and eight adults were micro-dissected bilaterally and documented ( n=58 sides). The superior cervical cardiac ramus originated from the superior cervical ganglion (present in all specimens) in 53% of cases. The middle cervical ganglion (incidence 81%) gave rise to the middle cervical cardiac ramus in 88% of cases. The cervico-thoracic ganglion (incidence 85%) gave the cervico-thoracic cardiac ramus in 84%. In the thoracic region, four cardiac rami arose from the T2-T6 segment of the thoracic sympathetic trunk. All cervical and thoracic cardiac rami were traced consistently to the deep cardiac plexus. Khogali et al.'s (1999) success of limited T2-T4 sympathectomy in relieving pain at rest of patients with intractable angina pectoris appears to indicate that a significant afferent pain pathway from the heart is selectively interrupted. The variability in pattern of the cervical ganglia, cardiac rami and cervical contributions to the cardiac plexus does not appear to affect the outcome of limited sympathectomy. The complexity of cardiac pain pathways is not fully understood. The study is continuing and attempts to contribute to defining these cardiac neuronal pathways.},

abstract = {The construct validity and the test-retest reliability of a self-administered questionnaire about habitual physical activity were investigated in young males (n = 139) and females (n = 167) in three age groups (20 to 22, 25 to 27, and 30 to 32 yr) in a Dutch population. By principal components analysis three conceptually meaningful factors were distinguished. They were interpreted as: 1) physical activity at work; 2) sport during leisure time; and 3) physical activity during leisure time excluding sport. Test-retest showed that the reliability of the three indices constructed from these factors was adequate. Further, it was found that level of education was inversely related to the work index, and positively related to the leisure-time index in both sexes. The subjective experience of work load was not related to the work index, but was inversely related to the sport index, and the leisure-time index in both sexes. The lean body mass was positively related the the work index, and the sport index in males, but was not related to the leisure-time index in either sex. These differences in the relationships support the subdivision of habitual physical activity into the three components mentioned above.},

abstract = {Microparticles (MPs) are cell-cell communication vesicles derived from the cell surface plasma membrane, although they are not known to originate from cardiac ventricular muscle. In ventricular cardiomyocytes, the membrane deformation protein cardiac bridging integrator 1 (cBIN1 or BIN1+13+17) creates transverse-tubule (t-tubule) membrane microfolds, which facilitate ion channel trafficking and modulate local ionic concentrations. The microfold-generated microdomains continuously reorganize, adapting in response to stress to modulate the calcium signaling apparatus. We explored the possibility that cBIN1-microfolds are externally released from cardiomyocytes. Using electron microscopy imaging with immunogold labeling, we found in mouse plasma that cBIN1 exists in membrane vesicles about 200 nm in size, which is consistent with the size of MPs. In mice with cardiac-specific heterozygous Bin1 deletion, flow cytometry identified 47% less cBIN1-MPs in plasma, supporting cardiac origin. Cardiac release was also evidenced by the detection of cBIN1-MPs in medium bathing a pure population of isolated adult mouse cardiomyocytes. In human plasma, osmotic shock increased cBIN1 detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and cBIN1 level decreased in humans with heart failure, a condition with reduced cardiac muscle cBIN1, both of which support cBIN1 release in MPs from human hearts. Exploring putative mechanisms of MP release, we found that the membrane fission complex endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT)-III subunit charged multivesicular body protein 4B (CHMP4B) colocalizes and coimmunoprecipitates with cBIN1, an interaction enhanced by actin stabilization. In HeLa cells with cBIN1 overexpression, knockdown of CHMP4B reduced the release of cBIN1-MPs. Using truncation mutants, we identified that the N-terminal BAR (N-BAR) domain in cBIN1 is required for CHMP4B binding and MP release. This study links the BAR protein superfamily to the ESCRT pathway for MP biogenesis in mammalian cardiac ventricular cells, identifying elements of a pathway by which cytoplasmic cBIN1 is released into blood.},

The disease is characterised by autonomic imbalance with increased sympathetic activity and withdrawal of parasympathetic activity. Despite the use of medical therapies that target, in part, the neurohormonal axis, rates of HF progression, morbidity and mortality remain high. Emerging therapies centred on neuromodulation of autonomic control of the heart provide an alternative device-based approach to restoring sympathovagal balance. Preclinical studies have proven favourable, while clinical trials have had mixed results. This article highlights the importance of understanding structural/functional organisation of the cardiac nervous system as mechanistic-based neuromodulation therapies evolve.},

abstract = {Ganglionated plexuses (GPs) are major constituents of the intrinsic cardiac nervous system, the final common integrator of regional cardiac control. We hypothesized that nicotinic stimulation of individual GPs exerts divergent regional influences, affecting atrial as well as ventricular functions. In 22 anesthetized canines, unipolar electrograms were recorded from 127 atrial and 127 ventricular epicardial loci during nicotine injection (100 mcg in 0.1 ml) into either the 1) right atrial (RA), 2) dorsal atrial, 3) left atrial, 4) inferior vena cava-inferior left atrial, 5) right ventricular, 6) ventral septal ventricular or 7) cranial medial ventricular (CMV) GP. In addition to sinus and AV nodal function, neural effects on atrial and ventricular repolarization were identified as changes in the area subtended by unipolar recordings under basal conditions and at maximum neurally-induced effects. Animals were studied with intact AV node or following ablation to achieve ventricular rate control. Atrial rate was affected in response to stimulation of all 7 GPs with an incidence of 50-95% of the animals among the different GPs. AV conduction was affected following stimulation of 6/7 GP with an incidence of 22-75% among GPs. Atrial and ventricular repolarization properties were affected by atrial as well as ventricular GP stimulation. Distinct regional patterns of repolarization changes were identified in response to stimulation of individual GPs. RAGP predominantly affected the RA and posterior right ventricular walls whereas CMVGP elicited biatrial and biventricular repolarization changes. Spatially divergent and overlapping cardiac regions are affected in response to nicotinic stimulation of neurons in individual GPs. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between depression and heart rate variability in cardiac patients. Methods: Heart rate variability was measured during 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring in 40 medically stable out-patients with documented coronary heart disease meeting current diagnostic criteria for major depression, and 32 nondepressed, but otherwise comparable, patients. Patients discontinued $\beta$-blockers and antidepressant medications at the time of study. Depressed patients were classified as mildly (n = 21) or moderately-to-severely depressed (n = 19) on the basis of Beck Depression Inventory scores. Results: There were no significant differences among the groups in age, gender, blood pressure, history of myocardial infarction, diabetes, or smoking. Heart rates were higher and nearly all indices of heart rate variability were significantly reduced in the moderately-to-severely versus the nondepressed group. Heart rates were also higher and mean values for heart rate variability lower in the mildly depressed group compared with the nondepressed group, but these differences did not attain statistical significance. Conclusion: The association of moderate to severe depression with reduced heart rate variability in patients with stable coronary heart disease may reflect altered cardiac autonomic modulation and may explain their increased risk for mortality.

abstract = {Hypertension (HTN) is the most common cause of hypertensive heart disease, which comprises of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), left atrial enlargement, diastolic dysfunction, functional mitral regurgitation and neurohormonal changes. All of these lead to significant arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation (AF) as well as ventricular arrhythmias, and are known risk factors for sudden cardiac death (SCD). The association between LVH and SCD is well established, especially in the presence of myocardial ischemia, fibrosis and scar tissue, and AF. Inflammation, fibrosis and oxidative stress, as well as ischemia play a significant role and are the leading pathways to remodeling, arrhythmias, and SCD. Aggressive HTN control may lead, at least in part, to regression of LVH and thus lower the risk of AF and SCD. Therefore, LVH is a powerful, independent predictor of AF, ventricular arrhythmias and SCD, and is significantly underrecognized. Further investigation of the relationship and management of diastolic dysfunction, LVH and genetic factors and their association with SCD is certainly warranted.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute inferior myocardial infarction (MI) often induces transient sinus bradycardia through vagal enhancement, known as Bezold-Jarisch reflex, which is explained by preferential distribution of vagal nerve in the inferior wall. We examined vagal activity in relation to the occurrence of residual ischemia in patients with old inferior MI and assessed its diagnostic usefulness. METHODS: Exercise myocardial scintigraphy was performed in 15 patients with old inferior MI, 19 angina pectoris (AP) patients with inferior ischemia but no MI, and 32 control subjects who had no evidence of cardiac disease. We analyzed the connection of residual ischemia in old MI with ST-segment response to exercise and with vagal activity as determined by coefficient of component variance of high frequency (CCV(HF)). RESULTS: Exercise-induced percentage change in CCV(HF) was higher in patients with old MI and residual ischemia (18.8 +/- 13.5%) and AP (5.5 +/- 9.7%) than old MI but no residual ischemia (-24.1 +/- 4.9%) or control (-22.8 +/- 4.5%, P = 0.006). Percentage change in CCV(HF) > -5% had a good diagnostic value for the detection of residual ischemia in patients with old inferior MI with sensitivity of 83%, specificity of 89%, accuracy of 87%, and positive likelihood ratio of 7.50, which was higher than that of ST-segment depression (67%, 50%, 56%, and 1.33). CONCLUSIONS: Vagal enhancement was associated with residual ischemia in old inferior MI as well as inferior AP. Measurement of CCV(HF) is useful in improving the diagnostic reliability of exercise electrocardiography in patients with old inferior MI.},

abstract = {Background--Low heart rate variability (HRV) is associated with a higher risk of death in patients with heart disease and in elderly subjects and with a higher incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) in the general population. Methods and Results--We studied the predictive value of HRV for CHD and death from several causes in a population study of 14 672 men and women without CHD, aged 45 to 65, by using the case-cohort design. At baseline, in 1987 to 1989, 2-minute rhythm strips were recorded. Time-domain measures of HRV were determined in a random sample of 900 subjects, for all subjects with incident CHD (395 subjects), and for all deaths (443 subjects) that occurred through 1993. Relative rates of incident CHD and cause-specific death in tertiles of HRV were computed with Poisson regression for the case-cohort design. Subjects with low HRV had an adverse cardiovascular risk profile and an elevated risk of incident CHD and death. The increased risk of death could not be attributed to a specific cause and could not be explained by other risk factors. Conclusions--Low HRV was associated with increased risk of CHD and death from several causes. It is hypothesized that low HRV is a marker of less favorable health.},

Forty-nine CABG patients (aged from 38 to 77 years) were examined by 24-h ambulatory electrocardiographic (AECG) monitoring, both preoperatively and 4 weeks after CABG. HRV spectral components were obtained by maximum entropy method analysis. Then the ULF, VLF, low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF) and total frequency (TF) components were compared before and after CABG. The average 24-h heart rate increased significantly after CABG (69+/-11.5 vs 82.9+/-10.9 beats per minute [bpm], P < 0.0001). The power of the ULF, VLF, and LF spectral components showed a decrease after surgery (2,859.9 vs 1,601.2 ms2, P<0.0001, 1,215.0 vs 572.3 ms2, P<0.0001, and 260.3 vs 125.9 ms2, P< 0.002, respectively), but the HF power did not show any significant change (98.7 vs 125.9 ms2, NS). Analysis of the normalized ratio of the ULF component (ULF/TF ratio) revealed a significant increase postoperatively (0.6496+/-0.0931 vs 0.7003+/-0.1338, P < 0.0001), but the VLF/TF and LF/TF ratios decreased after CABG (from 0.2671+/-0.0689 to 0.2040+/-0.0832, P< 0.0001 and from 0.0568+/-0.0290 to 0.0429+/-0.0232, P< 0.0088, respectively). In contrast, there was no significant alteration in the HF/TF ratio. These results suggest that recovery of cardiac autonomic activity is delayed after surgery. However, improvement of the ULF/TF ratio, one of the prognostic indicators for patients with cardiac disease, should be related to the relief of myocardial ischemia by CABG.},

abstract = {In the industrially developed countries, sudden cardiac death is the leading cause of death. It was recognized at the dawn of recorded history and even depicted in Egyptian relief sculpture from the tomb of a noble of the Sixth dynasty approximately 4,500 years ago. Sudden cardiac death has left no age untouched. Sparing neither saint nor sinner, it has burdened man with a sense of uncertainty and fragility. The enormity of this problem demands attention. In the United States, sudden cardiac death claims about 1,200 lives daily, or approximately one victim every minute. It is the leading cause of death among men aged 20 to 64 years, accounting for 32 percent of the fatalities in this group. Nearly 25 percent of persons dying suddenly have had no prior recognized symptoms of heart disease.The excess of widows observed in retirement communities is accounted for by the three- to fourfold greater incidence of sudden cardiac death among men. Sudden death in old age might be a blessing rather than a scourge, but instead it frequently explodes a man's life at its prime, at a median age of only 59 years. The medical profession has sensed the issue but has largely ignored sudden death as a problem amenable to solution. This indifference has not been the result of a lack of interest or concern but a reflection of the belief that sudden cardiac death was the inevitable culmination of coronary atherosclerosis. Because sudden death was unpredictable and afflicted the apparently healthy subject outside the hospital, the physician considered it an act of fate before which he was largely helpless. The advent of the coronary care unit has promoted a reassessment of this complex problem. It has become clear that sudden death is not the inexorable culmination of advanced coronary atherosclerosis but instead is the result of ventricular fibrillation and therefore is readily reversible.7,8If ventricular fibrillation were only the consequence of severe coronary atherosclerosis, once reversed it would promptly recur. However, patients treated for ventricular fibrillation seldom have recurring episodes, and they usually recover and survive for long periods.9,10The new concept that ventricular fibrillation is an electrical accident suggests that its cause is not anatomic and thereby contributes to the growing interest in redefining the basis for sudden death and developing methods for its containment. Until recently our inability to deal with sudden cardiac death has not been due to a gap in the application of knowledge but to a gap in knowledge itself. The purpose of this review is to indicate how much we know and to sketch the path of possible further progress. {\textcopyright} 1979.},

abstract = {I HAVE already described on various occasions [1] [2] the effect of small doses of adrenalin upon the mammalian heart under chloroform. When the heart is affected by low concentrations of chloroform it is thrown by the action of adrenalin into a condition known as ventricular fibrillation, but when affected by full concentrations, such, for instance, as a 2 per cent. proportion of vapour to the inhaled 'air, ventricular fibrillation does not occur. What I have to say tonight is but the logical sequence of this principle. EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE HEART AFFECTED BY CHLOROFORM. What is ventricular fibrillation? Let me say at once that we have not at present a distinct conception of its intimate nature, but we are aware that ineffectual ventricular contractions succeed one another at a very rapid rate, and the function of the ventricles is entirely abolished; its clinical manifestation is therefore a sudden vascular collapse, and consequent instantaneous death. In the lower mammals fibrillation is generally a permanent condition, but in exceptional cases spontaneous recovery of the heart takes place. In the human subject (judging by the accounts of syncope resulting from-the injections of adrenalin under chloroform) recovery from fibrillation is of not infrequent occurrence.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Downregulation of myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor density does not occur in a spatially uniform distribution in patients with congestive heart failure. Rather, it results primarily from loss of receptors in the subendocardium. In patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, beta 1-receptors have been found to be downregulated selectively. These observations suggest that considerable transmural heterogeneity in the distribution of beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes exists in the failing human heart. The present study was designed to test this hypothesis.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We used quantitative autoradiography of radioligand binding sites to measure the distribution of beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes in transmural sections of left ventricular myocardium obtained from cardiac transplant patients with ischemic (n = 13) and idiopathic dilated (n = 12) cardiomyopathy and from 4 subjects with no history of cognitive heart failure. Analysis of radioligand binding isotherms revealed a significant reduction in total beta-adrenergic receptor density in hearts of patients with ischemic and idiopathic cardiomyopathy (20.3 +/- 1.9 and 18.2 +/- 2.0 fmol/mg protein, respectively, versus 40.0 +/- 11.4 in control subjects; P < .01 for both). Loss of the beta 1-subtype accounted for 86% of the total reduction in beta-receptor density in failing hearts. Despite the significant decreases in overall tissue receptor content, the densities of total beta-receptors and beta-receptor subtypes in subepicardial myocytes were equivalent in failing and control hearts. However, in contrast to control hearts, in which the transmural distribution of total and beta 1-receptors was uniform (endocardial: epicardial receptor density ratios, 0.97 +/- 0.14 and 1.0 +/- 0.2, respectively), hearts of patients with ischemic and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy had significantly lower total beta-receptor and beta 1-receptor densities in the subendocardium (ratios, 0.66 +/- 0.06 and 0.46 +/- 0.09 for total and beta 1-receptors, respectively, in ischemic cardiomyopathy and 0.60 +/- 0.08 and 0.52 +/- 0.11 in dilated cardiomyopathy; P < .001 for all values compared with a ratio of 1). Thus, beta 1: beta 2 receptor density ratios were markedly decreased in the subendocardium of ischemic and idiopathic dilated left ventricles compared with control hearts.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: A significant transmural gradient in the density of myocardial beta 1-adrenergic receptors exists in the hearts of patients with ischemic and dilated cardiomyopathy, resulting in a markedly altered beta 1: beta 2 receptor density ratio in the subendocardium.},

The A1-adenosine receptors mediate the negative dromotropic, chronotropic, inotropic, and the anti-$\beta$-adrenergic actions of adenosine. Activation of A(2A)-and perhaps A(2B)-adenosine receptors causes vasodilation. Evidence of novel actions mediated by A(2B)- and A3-adenosine receptors is accumulating. Adenosine is cardioprotective during episodes of cardiac hypoxia/ischemia; several potential mechanisms may be involved. Pharmacologic tools are currently available for laboratory investigation of the actions of adenosine, and the development of adenosine receptor subtype-selective agonists and antagonists for therapeutic purposes is beginning.},

The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study found that anger proneness was an independent risk factor for CHD among normotensive, middle-aged men and women. 3 A meta-analysis reviewing several major epidemiological studies concluded that depression is an independent risk factor in the development of CHD in initially healthy people, with an overall relative risk of 1.64. 4 Other studies have also shown that depression increases short and long term mortality risk in patients with known CHD. 5,6 Lack of social support also portends a poor prognosis in patients after myocardial infarction (MI). 7,8 For example, among MI survivors, those with low to moderate levels of perceived social support had a 1-year post-CHD mortality rate about twofold higher than those with high levels of social support. 9 Furthermore, there is an interaction between depression and social support in relation to MI survival. 9 Although epidemiologic evidence is indicative, the results of psychosocial interventions after MI have Abstract: There is mounting evidence to suggest that psychosocial factors, including anger proneness, depression and social isolation, are risk factors for cardiovascu-lar disease. Nevertheless, evidence relating these factors to peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and intermittent claudication remains sparse. Using data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, we analyzed the relationship of psy-chosocial variables (Spielberger anger score, depression score from the Maastricht questionnaire, and a perceived social support scale) at study visit 2 with incident PAD (ankle-brachial index 0.9; a hospital discharge diagnosis of PAD, leg amputation, or leg revascularization procedures; or intermittent claudication). In 12 965 middle-aged adults with no prior history of PAD, 854 developed PAD over a mean follow-up time of 9.7 years, yielding an incidence rate of 6.8 per 1000 person years. A modest, monotonic dose-response, positive association between anger proneness and incident PAD was observed in a multivariable model: relative risk (RR) 1.15 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99-1.38) in the moderate anger group and RR 1.38 (95% CI 1.08-1.76) in the high anger group, compared with the low anger group. When compared with a low level of depressive symptoms, moderate and high levels of depressive symptoms were also associated with greater incident PAD, with multi-variable RRs of 1.20 (95% CI 0.99-1.45) and 1.44 (95% CI 1.19-1.74) respectively. There was no association of perceived level of social support with the occurrence of PAD. Anger proneness and depressive symptoms may be associated with the occurrence of PAD, as for other atherosclerotic syndromes. These findings may warrant confirmation in further studies and, if causal, could serve as a unique target for a PAD prevention trial.},

abstract = {The current study was designed to evaluate the effects of a disrupted social environment on the endothelial integrity of various vascular segments in male cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). Each of 20 single-caged adult monkeys was fed a diet comparable to a person's ingestion of 240 mg cholesterol/day for a 10-week baseline period and then was introduced as a stranger into a four-member social group for 3 days. Half of the monkeys received a beta-adrenergic blocking agent (metoprolol) via subcutaneous implant 2 days before and during group housing. The social manipulation produced persistent sympathetic arousal as evidenced by significantly elevated heart rates among untreated monkeys (p less than 0.01) but not among their metoprolol-treated counterparts, whose heart rate declined (p less than 0.05). After the social manipulation, all monkeys were necropsied and evaluated for endothelial incorporation of immunoglobulin G (as an indicator of cell death), endothelial cell replication, the presence of adherent leukocytes, and arterial low density lipoprotein permeability and concentration. At branching sites in the thoracic aorta, immunoglobulin G incorporation and endothelial cell replication were significantly greater in untreated monkeys than in metoprolol-treated monkeys (p less than 0.01 for both analyses); no differences existed at nonbranch sites. Endothelial cell replication in the coronary arteries (where immunoglobulin G incorporation was not examined) was also greater among untreated than among metoprolol-treated monkeys. No significant differences were observed between treatment groups in arterial low density lipoprotein permeability or leukocyte adherence; estimates of arterial low density lipoprotein concentrations were higher among untreated than among metoprolol-treated monkeys, but only in the abdominal portion of the aorta. These results indicate that social disruption is associated with both sympathetic nervous system arousal and indexes of endothelial dysfunction, effects that may be prevented by treatment with a beta-adrenergic blocking agent.},

abstract = {We have previously shown that direct vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) reduces the slope of action potential duration (APD) restitution while simultaneously protecting the heart against induction of ventricular fibrillation (VF) in the absence of any sympathetic activity or tone. In the current study we have examined the role of nitric oxide (NO) in the effect of VNS. Monophasic action potentials were recorded from a left ventricular epicardial site on innervated, isolated rabbit hearts (n = 7). Standard restitution, effective refractory period (ERP) and VF threshold (VFT) were measured at baseline and during VNS in the presence of the NO synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NA, 200 microm) and during reversing NO blockade with L-arginine (L-Arg, 1 mm). Data represent the mean +/- S.E.M. The restitution curve was shifted upwards and became less steep with VNS when compared to baseline. L-NA blocked the effect of VNS whereas L-Arg restored the effect of VNS. The maximum slope of restitution was reduced from 1.17 +/- 0.14 to 0.60 +/- 0.09 (50 +/- 5%, P < 0.0001) during control, from 0.98 +/- 0.14 to 0.93 +/- 0.12 (2 +/- 10%, P = NS) in the presence of L-NA and from 1.16 +/- 0.17 to 0.50 +/- 0.10 (41 +/- 9%, P = 0.003) with L-Arg plus L-NA. ERP was increased by VNS in control from 119 +/- 6 ms to 130 +/- 6 ms (10 +/- 5%, P = 0.045) and this increase was not affected by L-NA (120 +/- 4 to 133 +/- 4 ms, 11 +/- 3%, P = 0.0019) or L-Arg with L-NA (114 +/- 4 to 123 +/- 4 ms, 8 +/- 2%, P = 0.006). VFT was increased from 3.0 +/- 0.3 to 5.8 +/- 0.5 mA (98 +/- 12%, P = 0.0017) in control, 3.4 +/- 0.4 to 3.8 +/- 0.5 mA (13 +/- 12%, P = 0.6) during perfusion with L-NA and 2.5 +/- 0.4 to 6.0 +/- 0.7 mA (175 +/- 50%, P = 0.0017) during perfusion with L-Arg plus L-NA. Direct VNS increased VFT and flattened the slope of APD restitution curve in this isolated rabbit heart preparation with intact autonomic nerves. These effects were blocked using L-NA and reversed by replenishing the substrate for NO production with L-Arg. This is the first study to demonstrate that NO plays an important role in the anti-fibrillatory effect of VNS on the rabbit ventricle, possibly via effects on APD restitution.},

METHODS MIBG scintigraphy and power spectral analysis (PSA) of heart rate variability were performed simultaneously in 15 normal subjects. Anterior planar images and SPECT images were taken at five and two points after the injection of [123I]MIBG, respectively. In 10 of 15 subjects, 201TI myocardial SPECT was performed immediately after MIBG scintigraphy. RESULTS The heart/upper mediastinum MIBG uptake ratio in the planar image obtained at 240 min (r = 0.64, p < 0.01) and the washout rate of MIBG in the heart between 15 min and 240 min (r = 0.51, p < 0.05) showed significant correlation with the percentage of low frequency component of PSA (percent LF), an index of sympathetic nerve activity. Regional MIBG uptake in the inferior wall normalized by individual maximal uptake among all pixels was significantly correlated with the high frequency component of PSA, an index of parasympathetic nerve activity (r = -0.58, p < 0.05) and with mean R-R interval in a resting ECG (r = -0.82, p < 0.001) but did not correlate with percent LF, percent uptake of 201TI in the inferior wall or the liver/heart uptake ratio. CONCLUSION These results indicate that myocardial MIBG uptake correlates with sympathetic nerve activity in normal subjects. Our data indicate that heterogeneous MIBG distribution in the left ventricle is a physiologic rather than artifactual phenomenon and may be related to vagal tone rather than sympathetic nerve activity.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Depression is a risk factor for mortality after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), possibly as a result of altered autonomic nervous system (ANS) modulation of heart rate (HR) and rhythm. The purposes of this study were to determine: a) whether depressed patients are more likely to have an abnormal HR response (i.e., abnormal turbulence) to premature ventricular contractions (VPCs), and b) whether abnormal HR turbulence accounts for the effect of depression on increased mortality after AMI. METHODS Ambulatory electrocardiographic data were obtained from 666 (316 depressed, 350 nondepressed) patients with a recent AMI; 498 had VPCs with measurable HR turbulence. Of these, 260 had normal, 152 had equivocal, and 86 had abnormal HR turbulence. Patients were followed for up to 30 (median = 24) months. RESULTS Depressed patients were more likely to have abnormal HR turbulence (risk factor adjusted odds ratio = 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.0-3.0; p = .03) and have worse survival (odds ratio = 2.4; 95% CI = 1.2-4.6; p = .02) than nondepressed patients. When HR turbulence was added to the model, the adjusted hazard ratio for depression decreased to 1.9 (95% CI = 0.9-3.8; p = .08), and to 1.6 (95% CI = 0.8-3.4; p = .18) when a measure of HR variability (LnVLF) was added. The hazard was found to differ over time with depression posing little risk for mortality in year 1 but greater risk in years 2 and 3 of the follow up. CONCLUSION ANS dysregulation may partially mediate the increased risk for mortality in depressed patients with frequent VPCs after an AMI.},

Despite recommendations from some national organizations to screen for depression, it is unclear whether treatment of depression in patients with AMI is associated with better outcomes. We aimed to determine whether the prognosis of patients with treated versus untreated depression differs. METHODS The TRIUMPH study (Translational Research Investigating Underlying Disparities in Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients' Health Status) is an observational multicenter cohort study that enrolled 4062 patients aged ≥18 years with AMI between April 11, 2005, and December 31, 2008, from 24 US hospitals. Research coordinators administered the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) during the index AMI admission. Depression was defined by a PHQ-9 score of ≥10. Depression was categorized as treated if there was documentation of a discharge diagnosis, medication prescribed for depression, or referral for counseling, and as untreated if none of these 3 criteria was documented in the medical records despite a PHQ score ≥10. One-year mortality was compared between patients with AMI having: (1) no depression (PHQ-9<10; reference); (2) treated depression; and (3) untreated depression adjusting for demographics, AMI severity, and clinical factors. RESULTS Overall, 759 (18.7%) patients met PHQ-9 criteria for depression and 231 (30.4%) were treated. In comparison with 3303 patients without depression, the 231 patients with treated depression had 1-year mortality rates that were not different (6.1% versus 6.7%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-1.99). In contrast, the 528 patients with untreated depression had higher 1-year mortality in comparison with patients without depression (10.8% versus 6.1%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.91; 95% confidence interval, 1.39-2.62). CONCLUSIONS Although depression in patients with AMI is associated with increased long-term mortality, this association may be confined to patients with untreated depression.},

Patients underwent ambulatory ST segment monitoring off all routine antianginal treatment (total 6264 hours) and exercise testing (n = 146). Ninety one patients (61%) had a total of 598 episodes of significant ST segment change, of which 446 (75%) were asymptomatic. Twenty seven patients (18%) had only painless episodes; 14 (9%) patients only painful episodes; 50 patients (33%) had both painless and painful episodes. The mean number of ST segment changes per day was 2.58 (1.95 silent); however, 11 patients (7%) had 50% of all silent episodes, and 48 patients (32%) had 91% of all silent episodes. Fifty nine patients (39%) had no ST segment changes on ambulatory monitoring, and 73 patients (49%) had no evidence of silent ischaemia. Episodes of silent ischaemia occurred with a similar circadian distribution to that of painful ischaemia, predominantly between 0730 and 1930. There was a similar mean rise in heart rate at the onset of both silent and painful episodes of ischaemia. Silent ischaemia was significantly more frequent in patients with three vessel disease than in those with single vessel disease, and was also significantly related to both time to 1 mm ST depression and maximal exercise duration on exercise testing. There was a highly significant relation between the mean number and duration of episodes of silent ischaemia in patients with positive exercise tests when compared with those with negative tests.

abstract = {Major untoward events, such as life-threatening arrhythmias and acute coronary events, have been suggested to be triggered by the activation of the autonomic nervous system in patients with coronary artery disease. Analysis of heart rate variability by conventional time and frequency domain methods, as well as by newer methods derived from nonlinear system theory, has offered a novel approach for studying the abnormalities in cardiovascular neural regulation in ischemic heart disease. Heart rate variability has been shown to be altered among patients with ischemic heart disease as compared to their age-matched controls without the evidence of ischemic heart disease. There are also obvious differences in various measures of heart rate variability between patients with uncomplicated coronary artery disease and those with coronary artery disease with complicated myocardial infarction. Impaired high-frequency oscillations of heart rate is the most prominent feature in patients with uncomplicated coronary artery disease, suggesting mainly an impairment in vagal autonomic regulation. Patients with prior myocardial infarction have a reduced overall heart rate variability, and a specific spectral pattern with a reduced low-frequency spectral component has been observed in patients with prior myocardial infarction and impaired left ventricular function. Recent studies have shown that the new nonlinear measures, particularly fractal analysis methods of heart rate dynamics, can detect subtle changes in heart rate behavior that are not easily detected by traditional analysis methods from ambulatory recordings. Patients with prior myocardial infarction have steeper power-law slope analyzed from the ultra and very low-frequency spectral bands, and they also have more random short-term heart rate dynamics analyzed by the detrended fluctuation method. A large body of data indicate that reduced overall heart rate variability is associated with an increased risk of mortality and nonfatal cardiac events in patient with ischemic heart disease. Of particular note, recent studies indicate that fractal analysis methods perform even better than the traditional analysis methods of heart rate variability as predictors of death and the onset of life-threatening arrhythmic events in post-infarction populations. These findings support the notion that heart rate variability analysis methods, such as fractal and complexity measures as well as conventional techniques, give valuable clinical information among patients with ischemic heart disease.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Although adrenergic activation plays a major role in the initiation of experimental myocardial ischemia, the significance of alpha-adrenergic coronary constriction in humans has been questioned. The present study assessed the impact of selective alpha-adrenergic receptor activation in patients with normal or atherosclerotic coronary arteries. METHODS AND RESULTS In 39 patients, coronary blood flow (CBF, mL/min) was determined from combined angiography and Doppler measurements. In 8 patients with normal coronary arteries (group 1) and 9 with single coronary artery stenosis (group 2), doses of 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg IC of the alpha1-agonist methoxamine (M) were injected. Identical doses of the alpha2-agonist BHT933 (B) were injected in 8 patients with normal coronary arteries (group 3) and 8 with single stenosis (group 4). In 6 additional patients with single stenosis (group 5), aortocoronary sinus lactate differences were measured in response to M and B. CBF remained unchanged in group 1. In contrast, CBF was decreased dose-dependently in group 2, with a maximum at 10 mg M (39.0+/-9.4 versus 15.2+/-7.0). In groups 3 and 4, CBF was also decreased dose-dependently, with a maximum at 10 mg B (63.3+/-24.8 versus 49. 1+/-27.9 and 41.5+/-19.0 versus 12.7+/-8.0, respectively). In group 5, there was more net lactate production with B than with M (-0. 34+/-0.11 versus -0.04+/-0.09 mmol/L). CONCLUSIONS In normal coronary arteries, alpha1-adrenergic activation does not reduce CBF, whereas alpha2-adrenergic activation reduces CBF by microvascular constriction. Both alpha1- and alpha2-adrenergic epicardial and microvascular constriction are augmented by atherosclerosis and can induce myocardial ischemia.},

Previous studies demonstrated potential of analysis of short-term sequences of heart rate data in a time domain for continuous monitoring of levels of physiological stress however the value of HRV parameters in frequency domain for monitoring cycling exercise has not been established. The goal of this study was to assess whether HRV parameters in frequency domain differ depending on a stage of cycling exercise. We compared major HRV parameters in high, low and very low frequency ranges during rest, height of exercise, and recovery during cycling exercise. Our results indicated responsiveness of frequency-domain indices to different phases of cycling exercise program and their potential in monitoring autonomic balance and stress levels as a part of a tailored home-based telerehabilitation program. {\textcopyright} 2014 The authors and IOS Press.

abstract = {Although the occurrence of normal coronary arteriograms in patients with anginal pain is now recognized as a clinical entity, a large-scale study of such patients has not been reported. Accordingly, the historic aspects, laboratory findings and subsequent clinical course of 200 subjects (101 men and 99 women) with this syndrome were analyzed. Their average age was 47 years. No specific feature in the history could be discerned which separated these patients from those with angina due to coronary heart disease. The frequency of noncardiac sources of chest pain was similar in all patients. The electrocardiogram demonstrated abnormalities in the ST-T waves in slightly over 50 per cent of the patients, and the postexercise electrocardiogram was abnormal in another 20 per cent. Objective evidence for myocardial ischemia (myocardial lactate production) was three times more frequent in women than in men. The frequency of carbohydrate and/or lipid abnormalities was approximately half that in patients with coronary heart disease and did not correlate with the presence of myocardial ischemia. Long-term follow-up of these patients indicated that over half showed gradual improvement without specific therapy, whereas only 8 per cent had an increase in chest pain. Six patients died (four of unknown cause) in an average follow-up period of three years. Mortality, however, as determined by the life table method, was no greater than in a sex-age matched cohort derived from actuarial data. Although the etiology of this syndrome has not yet been demonstrated, its prognosis both in terms of persistence of pain and mortality appears to be benign. {\textcopyright} 1973.},

abstract = {This research was designed to compare coronary, carotid and aortic arch baroreceptors in terms of the ranges of pressures required to elicit reflex vascular responses and the possible differences between the responses to pulsatile and non-pulsatile stimuli. Dogs were anaesthetized with alpha-chloralose, artificially ventilated and the chests opened wide. A perfusion circuit allowed independent control of pressures distending the three baroreceptor regions. A cardiopulmonary bypass and ventricular fibrillation prevented cardiac pulsations from influencing coronary baroreceptor pressure. The caudal region of the animal was perfused at constant flow and vascular resistance responses were assessed from changes in perfusion pressure. Only tests in which the overall response exceeded 3 kPa (22.5 mmHg) were analyzed. Reflex responses were obtained to significantly lower coronary pressures than were required to induce responses from other regions. The inflexion points of the stimulus-response curves for pulsatile coronary, carotid and aortic pressures were 10.5 +/- 0.6, 15.5 +/- 1.8 and 16.4 +/- 1.7 kPa (79 +/- 5, 116 +/- 14 and 123 +/- 13 mmHg, respectively; values are means +/- S.E.M.). When the responses to pulsatile stimuli were compared with those to non-pulsatile stimuli, it was noted that for the carotid receptors, lower pressures were required to induce responses (inflexion pressure less) and the slope of the stimulus-response curve was less. Pulsatile aortic pressures induced a parallel (downward) displacement of the curve but no change in inflexion point or slope. The coronary baroreceptor stimulus-response relationship was unaffected by pulsatility. These results show differences between the characteristics of the three baroreceptors with coronary receptors being unaffected by pressure pulsatility but likely to be of importance in hypotensive situations.},

Recently, large prospective epidemiologic studies and smaller basic science studies have firmly established a connection between CVD and several psychological conditions, including depression, chronic psychological stress, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and anxiety. In addition, numerous clinical trials have been conducted to attempt to prevent or lessen the impact of these conditions on cardiovascular health. In this article, we review studies connecting depression, stress/PTSD, and anxiety to CVD, focusing on findings from the last 5 years. For each mental health condition, we first examine the epidemiologic evidence establishing a link with CVD. We then describe studies of potential underlying mechanisms and finally discuss treatment trials and directions for future research.},

abstract = {Microneurography is a method using metal microelectrodes to investigate directly identified neural traffic in myelinated as well as unmyelinated efferent and afferent nerves leading to and coming from muscle and skin in human peripheral nerves in situ. The present paper reviews how this technique has been used in clinical neurophysiology to elucidate the neural mechanisms of autonomic regulation, motor control and sensory functions in humans under physiological and pathological conditions. Microneurography is particularly important to investigate efferent and afferent neural traffic in unmyelinated C fibers. The recording of efferent discharges in postganglionic sympathetic C efferent fibers innervating muscle and skin (muscle sympathetic nerve activity; MSNA and skin sympathetic nerve activity; SSNA) provides direct information about neural control of autonomic effector organs including blood vessels and sweat glands. Sympathetic microneurography has become a potent tool to reveal neural functions and dysfunctions concerning blood pressure control and thermoregulation. This recording has been used not only in wake conditions but also in sleep to investigate changes in sympathetic neural traffic during sleep and sleep-related events such as sleep apnea. The same recording was also successfully carried out by astronauts during spaceflight. Recordings of afferent discharges from muscle mechanoreceptors have been used to understand the mechanisms of motor control. Muscle spindle afferent information is particularly important for the control of fine precise movements. It may also play important roles to predict behavior outcomes during learning of a motor task. Recordings of discharges in myelinated afferent fibers from skin mechanoreceptors have provided not only objective information about mechanoreceptive cutaneous sensation but also the roles of these signals in fine motor control. Unmyelinated mechanoreceptive afferent discharges from hairy skin seem to be important to convey cutaneous sensation to the central structures related to emotion. Recordings of afferent discharges in thin myelinated and unmyelinated fibers from nociceptors in muscle and skin have been used to provide information concerning pain. Recordings of afferent discharges of different types of cutaneous C-nociceptors identified by marking method have become an important tool to reveal the neural mechanisms of cutaneous sensations such as an itch. No direct microneurographic evidence has been so far proved regarding the effects of sympathoexcitation on sensitization of muscle and skin sensory receptors at least in healthy humans. {\textcopyright} 2006 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Observational studies have suggested that psychological stress increases the incidence of sudden cardiac death. Whether emotional or physical stressors can trigger spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias in patients at risk has not been systematically evaluated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) were given diaries to record levels of defined mood states and physical activity, using a 5-point intensity scale, during 2 periods preceding spontaneously occurring ICD shocks (0 to 15 minutes and 15 minutes to 2 hours) and during control periods 1 week later. ICD-stored electrograms confirmed the rhythm at the time of shock. A total of 107 confirmed ventricular arrhythmias requiring shock were reported by 42 patients (33 men; mean age, 65 years; 78% had coronary artery disease) between August 1996 and September 1999. In the 15 minutes preceding shock, an anger level > or =3 preceded 15% of events compared with 3% of control periods (P<0.04; odds ratio, 1.83; 95% confidence intervals, 1.04 to 3.16) Other mood states (anxiety, worry, sadness, happiness, challenge, feeling in control, or interest) did not differ. Patients were more physically active preceding shock than in control periods. Anger and physical activity were independently associated with the preshock period. CONCLUSIONS: Anger and physical activity can trigger ventricular arrhythmias in patients with ICDs. Future investigations of therapies aimed at blocking a response to these stressors may decrease ventricular arrhythmias and shocks in these patients.},

Resting, supine, 2-minute, beat-to-beat heart rate data were collected between 7 A.M. and 12 noon. The race- and sex-adjusted geometric means of low-frequency component (LF, 0.025 to 0.15 Hz) were 4.00 and 3.13 (beats/min)2; of high-frequency component (HF, 0.16 to 0.35 Hz), 1.65 and 1.21 (beats/min)2; and of the HF/LF ratio, 0.41 and 0.39, for 45-to-54 and 55-to-64 years age groups, respectively (test of mean difference by age, p < 0.01, p < 0.01, and p = 0.11 for LF, HF, and HF/LF ratio, respectively). Comparing black with white examinees, the age- and sex-adjusted geometric means of LF were 3.06 and 3.70 (beats/min)2; of HF, 1.66 and 1.36 (beats/min)2; of HF/LF, 0.54 and 0.37, respectively (test of mean difference by race, p < 0.01, p < 0.01, and p < 0.01).

abstract = {Cortisol has one of the most distinct and fascinating circadian rhythms in human physiology. This is regulated by the central clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. It has been suggested that cortisol acts as a secondary messenger between central and peripheral clocks, hence its importance in the synchronization of body circadian rhythms. Conventional immediate-release hydrocortisone, either at twice- or thrice-daily doses, is not capable of replicating physiological cortisol circadian rhythm and patients with adrenal insufficiency or congenital adrenal hyperplasia still suffer from a poor quality of life and increased mortality. Novel treatments for replacement therapy are therefore essential. Proof-of-concept studies using hydrocortisone infusions suggest that the circadian delivery of hydrocortisone may improve biochemical control and life quality in patients lacking cortisol with an impaired cortisol rhythm. Recently oral formulations of modified-release hydrocortisone are being developed and it has been shown that it is possible to replicate cortisol circadian rhythm and also achieve better control of morning androgen levels. These new drug therapies are promising and potentially offer a more effective treatment with less adverse effects. Definite improvements clearly need to be established in future clinical trials.},

abstract = {Early childhood trauma has been associated with increased risk for subsequent coronary heart disease (CHD), but little is known regarding what role genetic and shared familial factors play in this relationship. Early trauma was measured retrospectively in 562 male middle-aged twins with the Early Trauma Inventory. CHD was assessed by history and by myocardial perfusion imaging with positron emission tomography [(13)N] ammonia. Coronary flow reserve, a measure of coronary microcirculatory function, was defined as the ratio of myocardial blood flow at rest to flow during stress. Early trauma was associated with a higher prevalence of CHD by clinical history, OR = 1.48 per early trauma inventory quartile increase, 95% CI [1.18, 1.86]. When within- and between-pair effects were estimated, only the between-pair association was significant, OR = 1.76, 95% CI [1.30, 2.40], showing that the odds of CHD in the twin pair increased as the average early trauma exposure in the pair increased. A marginal between-pair (but not within-pair) relationship was also found between early trauma and coronary flow reserve (n = 416, unstandardized B = -0.04, SE B = 0.02, p = .036). In conclusion, early trauma was associated with CHD and familial factors played a key role.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine if autonomic nerve interventions exerted quantitatively dissimilar effects on recovery properties of endocardium compared with epicardium. Effective refractory periods (ERP) were measured by the extrastimulus technique in the endocardium and epicardium of the canine left ventricular anterior wall. The basic train and premature stimuli were administered to the endocardium and overlying epicardium via different poles on the same multipolar needle electrode, using cathodal stimuli. Sympathetic augmentation produced via bilateral carotid arterial occlusion or electrical stimulation of right, left, and both sympathetic nerves shortened ERP. Bilateral sympathetic denervation prolonged ERP. The canges in ERP of the endocardium were no different than were changes in the ERP of overlying epicardium. In separate studies, electrical stimulation of the cervical vagi prolonged ERP similarly in epicardium and endocardium. Pacing at slower rates or physostigmine administration potentiated the ERP prolongation in endocardium similar to epicardium. Augmented sympathetic tone produced by carotid occlusion also potentiated prolongation of ERP by vagal stimulation. The percent change in endocardial sites was slightly but significantly less than in epicardial sites. ERP prolongation due to vagal stimulation was attenuated markedly after sympathectomy and abolished with both propranolol and atropine. We conclude that, in the normal anterior left ventricular myocardium of the dog, sympathetic augmentation shortens ERP in epicardial sites equivalent to that in the underlying endocardial sites, that vagal nerve stimulation prolongs ERP in epicardial sites equal to or slightly greater than in the underlying endocardial sites, and that vagal stimulation antagonizes background sympathetic activity.},

Haller, Maria Korre, Konstantina Sampani, Luiz Guilherme Grossi Porto, Patricia C. Fehling, Costas A. Christophi, Stefanos N. Kales Abstract Sudden cardiac death accounted for 42% of all firefighter duty-related fatalities over the last decade. This retrospective study analyzed available medical examiner records for duty-related firefighter fatalities among male firefighters 18–65 years of age that occurred between 1999 and 2014 and reported the pathoanatomic substrate for cardiac-related fatalities. Odds of duty-related cardiac death during specific duties compared with fire station duties were calculated by pathoanatomic substrate. There were 285 cardiac fatalities. Eighty percent of fatalities had evidence at autopsy of coronary heart disease (CHD) and increased heart size (cardiomegaly/left ventricular hypertrophy). CHD alone, cardiomegaly or left ventricular hypertrophy, and causes other than CHD or increased heart size were identified in 7.7%, 6.0%, and 6.7% of fatalities, respectively. The largest proportion of deaths occurred during fire suppression (33%), although only 1% of annual occupational time was estimated to be spent performing this duty. For deaths attributed to CHD and increased heart size, fire suppression, alarm response, and physical training were associated with approximately a 112-fold, 8-fold, and 7-fold increased risk of cardiac death, respectively, compared with station duties. In conclusion, the majority of firefighters who suffered a duty-related cardiac death had CHD and increased heart size, which was associated with a markedly increased risk of death during fire suppression compared with station duties. Targeted occupational medical screening for CHD and increased heart size may reduce duty-related cardiac deaths among firefighters.},

abstract = {Objectives: Cardiac repolarization may be affected by psychiatric disorders and/or antidepressant use, but evidence for this is inconclusive. This study examined the relationship between depressive and anxiety disorder and use of antidepressants with T-wave amplitude (TWA) and QT-interval. Methods: Data was obtained from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (n = 1,383). Depression/anxiety was diagnosed with the DSM-IV based Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The use of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin and noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) was established. T-wave amplitude and QT-interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) were obtained from an ECG measured in a type II axis configuration. Results: Compared to controls, persons with depression or anxiety disorders did not show a significantly different TWA (p = 0.58; Cohen's d = 0.046) or QTc (p = 0.48; Cohen's d = -0.057). In spite of known sympathomimetic effects, TCA use (p = 0.26; Cohen's d = -0.162) and SNRI use (p = 0.70; Cohen's d = -0.055) were not significantly associated with a lower TWA. TCA use (p = 0.12; Cohen's d = 0.225) and SNRI use (p = 0.11; Cohen's d = 0.227) were also not significantly associated with a prolonged QTc. Conclusion: We did not find evidence that either depressive/anxiety disorder or antidepressant use is associated with abnormalities in TWA or QTc. Earlier found sympathomimetic effects of TCAs and SNRIs are not evident in these measures of cardiac repolarization.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED Abnormal exercise perfusion findings have been described as false-positive for coronary artery disease in patients with suspected angina and angiographically normal coronary arteries. METHODS The significance of this finding was further investigated by obtaining intravascular sonograms and Doppler guidewire measurements of at least 2 coronary arteries in 20 consecutive patients who had chest pain, normal coronary angiography findings, and positive stress-rest sestamibi SPECT findings. The summed reversible score was used to describe the extent and severity of reversible perfusion defects. On the basis of scintigraphy findings, vessels were grouped as supplying underperfused myocardial segments (target vessels, n = 20) or normal territories (reference vessels, n = 25). The presence and extension of atherosclerotic disease of the epicardial arteries were assessed by intracoronary sonography. Measurements of plaque area (PA), vessel area (VA), and relative cross-sectional PA (RPA) (RPA = PA/VA) were obtained at the site of maximum plaque concentration. The coronary flow velocity reserve (CFR) was assessed during adenosine-induced hyperemia, and the relative flow reserve was calculated as the target-to-reference coronary reserve ratio. RESULTS The median summed reversible score was 3 (range, 1-6). Intracoronary sonography showed occult atherosclerosis in 19 patients (95%), with RPA greater than 40% in 16 patients (80%). Mean RPA was significantly greater in the target vessels (46% +/- 14%) than in reference vessels (12% +/- 18%; P < 0.0001). Doppler flow velocity measurements showed abnormal vasodilation capacity (CFR < 2.5) in 14 patients (70%). Mean CFR was significantly lower in the target vessels than in the reference vessels (2.3 +/- 0.5 versus 3.1 +/- 0.6; P < 0.0001). A significant inverse correlation was seen between the summed reversible score and the coronary reserve ratio (y = 9.05x - 9.9; r = 0.70; P < 0.005). CONCLUSION Reversible perfusion defects seen on SPECT images are often associated with angiographically unrecognized occult atherosclerotic changes and an abnormal vasodilation capacity of the coronary circulation. The tendency to dismiss abnormal exercise perfusion findings as false-positive in these patients may be unjustified.},

abstract = {Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia are directly associated with autonomic flexibility, self-regulation and well-being, and inversely associated with physiological stress, psychological stress and pathology. Yoga enhances autonomic activity, mitigates stress and benefits stress-related clinical conditions, yet the relationship between autonomic activity and psychophysiological responses during yoga practices and stressful stimuli has not been widely explored. This experimental study explored the relationship between HRV, mood states and flow experiences in regular yoga practitioners (YP), non-yoga practitioners (NY) and people with metabolic syndrome (MetS), during Mental Arithmetic Stress Test (MAST) and various yoga practices. The study found that the MAST placed a cardio-autonomic burden in all participants with the YP group showing the greatest reactivity and the most rapid recovery, while the MetS group had significantly blunted recovery. The YP group also reported a heightened experience of flow and positive mood states compared to NY and MetS groups as well as having a higher vagal tone during all resting conditions. These results suggest yoga practitioners have a greater homeostatic capacity and autonomic, metabolic and physiological resilience. Further studies are now needed to determine if regular yoga practice may improve autonomic flexibility in non-yoga practitioners and metabolic syndrome patients.

There was good agreement between PHQ diagnoses and those of independent mental health professionals (for the diagnosis of any 1 or more PHQ disorder, $\kappa$ = 0.65; overall accuracy, 85%; sensitivity, 75%; specificity, 90%), similar to the original PRIME-MD. Patients with PHQ diagnoses had more functional impairment, disability days, and health care use than did patients without PHQ diagnoses (for all group main effects, P<.001). The average time required of the physician to review the PHQ was far less than to administer the original PRIME-MD (<3 minutes for 85% vs 16% of the cases). Although 80% of the physicians reported that routine use of the PHQ would be useful, new management actions were initiated or planned for only 117 (32%) of the 363 patients with 1 or more PHQ diagnoses not previously recognized.ConclusionOur study suggests that the PHQ has diagnostic validity comparable to the original clinician-administered PRIME-MD, and is more efficient to use.},

We aimed to assess the association of adiponectin-related genetic variants resulting from GWAS in East Asians (loci in/near CDH13, ADIPOQ, WDR11FGF, CMIP and PEPD) with LVMI, and to examine whether sleep duration modified these genetic associations in youth. The 559 subjects aged 15–28 years were recruited from the Beijing Child and Adolescent Metabolic Syndrome study. Among the six loci, CDH13 rs4783244 was significantly correlated with adiponectin levels (p = 8.07 × 10−7). The adiponectin-rising allele in rs4783244 locus was significantly associated with decreased LVMI (p = 6.99 × 10−4) after adjusting for classical cardiovascular risk factors, and further for adiponectin levels, while no significant association was found between the other loci and LVMI. Moreover, we observed a significant interaction effect between rs4783244 and sleep duration (p =.005) for LVMI; the genetic association was more evident in long sleep duration while lost in short sleep duration. Similar interaction was found in the subgroup analysis using longitudinal data (p =.025 for interaction). In this young Chinese population, CDH13 rs4783244 represents a key locus for cardiac structure, and confers stronger cardio-protection in longer sleep duration when contrasted with short sleep duration.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE—Heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function, has been associated with cognitive function, but studies are conflicting. Previous studies have also not controlled for familial and genetic influences. METHODS—We performed power spectral analysis on 24-hour ambulatory ECG's in 416 middle-aged male twins from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Memory and learning were measured by verbal and visual selective reminding tests (SRT). Mixed-effect regression models were used to calculate associations between and within twin pairs, while adjusting for covariates. RESULTS—The mean age (SD) was 55 (2.9) years. A statistically significant positive association was found between measures of HRV and verbal, but not visual, SRT scores. The most statistically significant unadjusted association was found between very low frequency (VLF) HRV and verbal total recall SRT, such that each logarithm of increase in VLF was associated with an increased verbal SRT score of 4.85 points (p=0.002). The association persisted despite adjustment for demographic and cardiovascular risk factors, and after accounting for familial, and genetic factors by comparing twins within pairs. A significant interaction was found between post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and HRV, such that total power and ultra low frequency were associated with SRT in twins (n=362) without PTSD, but not in those with PTSD. CONCLUSION—In conclusion, lower frequency spectra of HRV are associated with verbal, but not visual, learning and memory, particularly in subjects without PTSD. This association may indicate that autonomic nervous system dysregulation plays a role in cognitive decline.},

Schruers, Klaus Wiedemann, C{\"{u}}neyt Demiralay Abstract Background The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) and the autonomic nervous system (ANS) are considered to play the most crucial role in the pathophysiology of stress responsiveness and are increasingly studied together. However, only few studies have simultaneously assessed HPA axis and ANS activity to investigate their direct interaction in pathophysiology, while no study so far has assessed the dynamic interplay between the two systems in healthy subjects through endocrine challenges. Methods The present study assessed the direct effects of overnight pharmacoendocrine HPA axis challenges with dexamethasone (suppression) and metyrapone (stimulation) on ANS activity at rest as determined by linear and nonlinear measures of heart rate variability (HRV) in 39 young healthy individuals. Results Findings indicated significant effects of metyrapone, but not dexamethasone on autonomic activity at rest based on HRV measures. HRV after metyrapone was overall significantly reduced in comparison to baseline or post-dexamethasone conditions, while the combined metyrapone-related reduction of HRV measures RMSSD, NN50(%) and HF(%) with concomitant increase of the unifractal scaling coefficient $\alpha$fast value jointly indicated a specifically diminished vagal activity. Conclusions We provide first data that HPA axis stimulation (metyrapone) is associated with reduced vagal tone, while HPA axis suppression (dexamethasone) has no effect on autonomic modulation of heart function. Our results support a vital role of the parasympathetic nervous system in the interplay between ANS and HPA axis and, thus, in the modulation of stress-related cardiovascular responsiveness and the susceptibility to stress-related disorders.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Autonomic dysfunction frequently occurs in the context of Parkinson disease (PD) and may precede onset of motor symptoms. Limited data exist on the prospective association of heart rate variability (HRV), a marker of autonomic function, with PD risk.\nMETHODS: We included 12,162 participants of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, a community-based cohort, without a diagnosis of PD at baseline (1987-1989) and with available HRV data (mean age = 54 years, 57% women). A 2-minute electrocardiogram was used to measure HRV. Incident PD was identified through 2008 from multiple sources, and adjudicated. Multivariable Cox models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of PD by quartiles of HRV measurements.\nRESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 18 years, we identified 78 incident PD cases. Lower values of the root mean square of successive differences in normal-to-normal R-R intervals (rMSSD) and standard deviation of normal-to-normal R-R intervals (SDNN), markers of parasympathetic activity and total variability, respectively, were associated with higher PD risk during follow-up. In multivariate models, the HR (95% CI) of PD in the bottom quartiles of rMSSD and SDNN compared to the top quartiles were 2.1 (1.0-4.3) and 2.9 (1.4-6.1), respectively. Other measures of cardiac autonomic function, including mean R-R interval and frequency-domain measurements, were not associated with PD risk.\nINTERPRETATION: In this prospective cohort, decreased HRV was associated with an increased risk of PD. Assessment of cardiac autonomic function may help identify individuals at risk for PD.},

abstract = {The factors that contribute to the occurrence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in patients with chronic myocardial infarction (MI) are not entirely clear. The present study tests the hypothesis that augmented sympathetic nerve regeneration (nerve sprouting) increases the probability of ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF), and SCD in chronic MI. In dogs with MI and complete atrioventricular (AV) block, we induced cardiac sympathetic nerve sprouting by infusing nerve growth factor (NGF) to the left stellate ganglion (experimental group, n=9). Another 6 dogs with MI and complete AV block but without NGF infusion served as controls (n=6). Immunocytochemical staining revealed a greater magnitude of sympathetic nerve sprouting in the experimental group than in the control group. After MI, all dogs showed spontaneous VT that persisted for 5.8+/-2.0 days (phase 1 VT). Spontaneous VT reappeared 13.1+/-6.0 days after surgery (phase 2 VT). The frequency of phase 2 VT was 10-fold higher in the experimental group (2.0+/-2.0/d) than in the control group (0.2+/-0.2/d, P<0.05). Four dogs in the experimental group but none in the control group died suddenly of spontaneous VF. We conclude that MI results in sympathetic nerve sprouting. NGF infusion to the left stellate ganglion in dogs with chronic MI and AV block augments sympathetic nerve sprouting and creates a high-yield model of spontaneous VT, VF, and SCD. The magnitude of sympathetic nerve sprouting may be an important determinant of SCD in chronic MI.},

abstract = {Heart failure is a syndrome characterized initially by left ventricular dysfunction that triggers countermeasures aimed to restore cardiac output. These responses are compensatory at first but eventually become part of the disease process itself leading to further worsening cardiac function. Among these responses is the activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) that provides inotropic support to the failing heart increasing stroke volume, and peripheral vasoconstriction to maintain mean arterial perfusion pressure, but eventually accelerates disease progression affecting survival. Activation of SNS has been attributed to withdrawal of normal restraining influences and enhancement of excitatory inputs including changes in: 1) peripheral baroreceptor and chemoreceptor reflexes; 2) chemical mediators that control sympathetic outflow; and 3) central integratory sites. The interface between the sympathetic fibers and the cardiovascular system is formed by the adrenergic receptors (ARs). Dysregulation of cardiac beta1-AR signaling and transduction are key features of heart failure progression. In contrast, cardiac beta2-ARs and alpha1-ARs may function in a compensatory fashion to maintain cardiac inotropy. Adrenergic receptor polymorphisms may have an impact on the adaptive mechanisms, susceptibilities, and pharmacological responses of SNS. The beta-AR blockers and the inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis form the mainstay of current medical management of chronic heart failure. Conversely, central sympatholytics have proved harmful, whereas sympathomimetic inotropes are still used in selected patients with hemodynamic instability. This review summarizes the changes in SNS in heart failure and examines how modulation of SNS activity may affect morbidity and mortality from this syndrome. {\textcopyright} 2009 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Depression is associated with an increased risk for mortality after acute myocardial infarction (MI). The purpose of this study was to determine whether low heart rate variability (HRV) mediates the effect of depression on mortality. METHODS: Twenty-four-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms were obtained from 311 depressed patients with a recent acute MI who were enrolled in the Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease (ENRICHD) clinical trial and from 367 nondepressed patients who met the ENRICHD medical inclusion criteria. Standard HRV indexes were extracted from the recordings. RESULTS: The log of very low-frequency (LnVLF) power, an index of HRV derived from power spectral analysis of the electrocardiogram signal (0.0033-0.04 Hz [in milliseconds squared]), was lower in the depressed than in the nondepressed patients (P<.001). There were 47 deaths (6.1%) during a 30-month follow-up. After adjusting for potential confounders, the depressed patients remained at higher risk for all-cause mortality compared with the nondepressed patients (hazard ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-5.4; P<.003). When LnVLF power was entered into the model, the hazard ratio for depression dropped to 2.1 (95% CI, 1.1-4.2; P = .03). The proportion of the risk for depression attributable to LnVLF power was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.23-0.31; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Low HRV partially mediates the effect of depression on survival after acute MI. This finding helps to clarify the physiological mechanisms underlying depression's role as a risk factor for mortality in patients with coronary heart disease. It also raises the possibility that treatments that improve both depression and HRV might also improve survival in these patients.},

abstract = {Background: Abnormal stress myocardial perfusion imaging studies (SMPI) with angiographically insignificant coronary artery disease (ICAD) have often been labeled "false positive" scans. We evaluated the prognostic predictors and outcomes in an unselected patient population having abnormal SMPI and ICAD (study group) over a 24 month period of follow-up. Methods: Retrospective study of consecutive patients who had SMPI and subsequent coronary angiography showing ICAD within 6 months of index scan with matched control group with normal scans. Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) were defined as the first occurrence of death or myocardial infarction (MI). Patients were followed up to 24 months from the time of their SMPI to identify the development of MACE. Results: One hundred and twenty five patients formed the study group and one hundred and thirty six patients formed the control group. Over a two-year follow up, approximately 13% of the study group had MACE as compared to 4.2% in the control group (P = .022). Abnormal SMPI, EF < 40% and chronic kidney disease (GFR < 60 ml/min) were independent predictors of MACE in the study group. In multivariate analysis for MACE prediction, chronic kidney disease remained the sole independent predictor regardless of size or severity of perfusion abnormalities (P = <.001). Conclusion: Patients with abnormal SMPI and ICAD have a 13% event rate of MACE over a two-year follow up. CKD seems a very important marker of a higher risk subgroup amongst such patients. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Society of Nuclear Cardiology.},

abstract = {Accurate measurements of autonomic nerve regulation in heart failure (HF) were unresolved. The discriminating performance of deceleration and acceleration capacities of heart rate in HF was evaluated in 130 HF patients and 212 controls. Acceleration capacity and deceleration capacity were independent risk factors for HF in males, evaluated by multiple logistic regression analysis, with odds ratios (ORs) of 5.94 and 0.13, respectively. Acceleration capacity was also an independent risk factor for HF in females, with an OR of 8.58. Deceleration capacity was the best cardiac electrophysiological index to classify HF in males, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.88. Deceleration capacity was the best classification factor of HF in females with an AUC of 0.97, significantly higher than even left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Acceleration capacity also showed high performance in classifying HF in males (0.84) and females (0.92). The cut-off values of deceleration capacity for HF classification in males and females were 4.55 ms and 4.85 ms, respectively. The cut-off values of acceleration capacity for HF classification in males and females were −6.15 ms and −5.75 ms, respectively. Our study illustrates the role of acceleration and deceleration capacity measurements in the neuro-pathophysiology of HF. Heart failure (HF) refers to structural or functional impairment in the ventricular filling or ejection of blood, which may lead to fluid retention, pulmonary congestion, peripheral edema, and a complex clinical syndrome 1 . HF may be caused by disorders of the myocardium, heart valves, pericardium, and endocardium 2 . Hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and certain metabolic abnormalities are also common etiological factors of HF 3 . HF is a major challenge to public health; in the United States, there are as many as 650,000 new cases diagnosed annually, and this rate has remained stable over the past several decades 4 . The absolute mortality rate for HF is estimated to be $\sim$50% within 5 years of diagnosis 1,5 . The physiological activity of the heart is controlled and modulated by the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems 6,7 . The sympathetic nervous system has a wide variety of cardiovascular actions, including heart rate acceleration, increased cardiac contractility, reduction of venous capacitance, and constriction of resistance vessels 7,8 . The cardiovascular effects of the parasympathetic nervous system (vagus nerve) include heart rate reduction by inhibiting the sympathetic nervous system and by direct hyperpolarization of sinus nodal cells 6,9 . Disorders in parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems of the heart may coexist with serious heart conse-quences, including HF 6,9 . Dysregulation of cardiac adrenergic receptor signaling and transduction will influence cardiac inotropy and is a key feature in HF progression 7,10 . In contrast, the pathophysiological roles of normal and disordered parasympathetic innervation in heart are not as well understood 6–11 . The real-time roles of the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems on the heart are difficult to monitor. However, increasing numbers of studies have shown that these roles are reflected in cardiac electro-physiology 6–11 . Heart rate variability (HRV) is the physiological phenomenon of variation in the interval between heart beats, which can be measured and calculated from a continuous electrocardiograph record 12 . In recent decades, time and frequency domain measures of HRV have been considered to represent promising markers of a significant relationship among autonomic nervous system activity, HF, and cardiovascular mortality 12,13 . Although evidence for an association between a propensity for lethal arrhythmias and signs of increased sym-pathetic or reduced vagal activity is abundant, the significance of the many different HRV indexes is more com-plex than generally appreciated, and there is potential for incorrect conclusions and for excessive or unfounded extrapolations 12 . In 2006, Baver et al. established an approach to distinguish between vagal and sympathetic nervous system roles that affect cardiac electrophysiology using a signal processing algorithm to separately characterize the decel-eration and acceleration capacities of the heart rate 14 . The deceleration and acceleration capacities of heart rate were quantified by assessing 24-h ambulatory electrocardiogram recordings 14,15 . The authors found that decreased heart rate deceleration capacity was a powerful predictor of mortality after myocardial infarction, better than left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), conventional measures of HRV, and the combination of the two 14 . Their report advanced cardiac electrophysiological analysis and provided a new approach to quantify the effects of the vagal and sympathetic nervous systems on heart physiology. Although elevated sympathetic activity is associated with an adverse prognosis, and a high level of parasym-pathetic activation confers cardioprotection 6 , a multitude of unknown questions still need to be answered. The parasympathetic actions on the heart are mediated not only by cardiac muscarinic receptor stimulation but also by many known and unknown mechanisms 6 . The role of the vagal nerve in heart biological activity has only recently been investigated in human subjects with HF. Thus, we should consider that any novel approach might advance our knowledge of cardiac nerve electrophysiology. In this report, the significance of acceleration capacity and deceleration in HF was evaluated comprehensively by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and multiple logistic regression analysis together with echocardiographic and HRV indexes under strict statistical quality con-trol. Our data provide new insights into how parasympathetic and sympathetic activation affects HF.},

abstract = {Ageing is the primary risk factor for cognitive deterioration. Given that the cerebral blood flow (CBF) or regulation of cerebral circulation is attenuated in the elderly, it could be expected that ageing-induced cognitive deterioration may be affected by a decrease in CBF as a result of brain ischemia and energy depletion. CBF regulation associated with cerebral metabolism thus likely plays an important role in the preservation of cognitive function. However, in some specific conditions (e.g. during exercise), change in CBF does not synchronize with that of cerebral metabolism. Our recent study demonstrated that cognitive function was more strongly affected by changes in cerebral metabolism than by changes in CBF during exercise. Therefore, it remains unclear how an alteration in CBF or its regulation affects cognitive function. In this review, I summarize current knowledge on previous investigations providing the possibility of an interaction between regulation of CBF or cerebral metabolism and cognitive function.},

abstract = {Background: Both race and social class influence cardiovascular outcomes, through mechanisms not yet fully understood. Minority race and lower social class are sources of chronic stress, which can alter autonomic nervous system function. Heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function, is also an important predictor of cardiovascular outcomes. Methods: To determine whether minority race/ethnicity and lower social class are associated with depressed HRV, we prospectively collected data on sociodemographic, clinical, psychological, and behavioral factors by survey in 360 outpatients undergoing ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Heart rate variability (24-hour) was measured by frequency domain analysis. Results: In unadjusted analysis, African Americans had lower HRV than whites, and individuals of lower social class as measured by education, occupation, and income had lower HRV than those of higher class. In multivariable analysis, both race and social class were independent predictors of ultralow frequency power after controlling for clinical and psychological factors. African Americans were 3.45 (95% CI 1.74-6.98, P = .0004) times as likely as whites to have depressed HRV (ultralow frequency power, lowest tertile), and non-college graduates 2.94 (95% CI, 1.71-5.14, P = .0001) times as likely as college graduates to have depressed HRV. Conclusions: Heart rate variability is lower in African Americans and individuals of lower social class, independent of the effects of measured clinical, psychological, or behavioral factors. This suggests that the adverse effects of minority race and lower social class on cardiovascular outcomes may be mediated by dysregulation of autonomic function. {\textcopyright} 2005, Mosby, Inc.

abstract = {The immunological problems of pig hearts supporting life in human recipients have potentially been solved by transgenic technology. Nevertheless, other problems still remain. Autonomic innervation is important for the control of cardiac dynamics and there is evidence suggesting that some neurons remain intact after transplantation. Previous studies in the human heart have established regional differences in both general autonomic innervation and in its component neural subpopulations. Such studies are lacking in the pig heart. Quantitative immunohistochemical and histochemical techniques were used to demonstrate the pattern of innervation in pig hearts (Sus scrofa). Gradients of immunoreactivity for the general neural marker protein gene product 9.5 were observed both within and between the endocardial, myocardial and epicardial plexuses throughout the 4 cardiac chambers. An extensive ganglionated plexus was observed in the epicardial tissues and, to a lesser extent, in the myocardial tissues. The predominant neural subpopulation displayed acetylcholinesterase activity, throughout the endocardium, myocardium and epicardium. These nerves showed a right to left gradient in density in the endocardial plexus, which was not observed in either the myocardial or epicardial plexuses. A large proportion of nerves in the ganglionated plexus of the atrial epicardial tissues displayed AChE activity, together with their cell bodies. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive nerves were the next most prominent subpopulation throughout the heart. TH-immunoreactive cell bodies were observed in the atrial ganglionated plexuses. Endocardial TH- and NPY-immunoreactive nerves also displayed a right to left gradient in density, whereas in the epicardial tissues they showed a ventricular to atrial gradient. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-immunoreactive nerves were the most abundant peptide-containing subpopulation after those possessing NPY immunoreactivity. They were most abundant in the epicardial tissues of the ventricles. Several important differences were observed between the innervation of the pig heart compared with the human heart. These differences may have implications for the function of donor transgenic pig hearts within human recipients.},

abstract = {Background: The autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays an important role in the initiation and maintenance of atrial fibrillation (AF), and modulation of the ANS function may contribute to AF control. Methods: Anesthetized dogs received either sham treatment (SHAM group, n= 8) or low-level carotid baroreceptor stimulation (LL-CBS) treatment (LL-CBS group, n= 8). The stimulation voltage was set at 80% below the threshold. To simulate focal AF, high-frequency stimulation (HFS) was applied to local nerves during the atrial refractory period. Multielectrode catheters were attached to the atria and all the pulmonary veins to determine the changes in the AF threshold (AF-TH), the atrial effective refractory period (AERP), and the window of vulnerability (WOV) during HFS in both groups. Microelectrodes were inserted into the anterior right ganglionated plexus (ARGP) to record neural firing. Results: HFS induced sinus rate (SR) slowing in the superior left ganglionated plexus (SLGP). LL-CBS induced a progressive increase in AF-TH and AERP at all sites and a significant decrease in the sum of WOV at 2 hours (all P < 0.05). LL-CBS inhibited the ability of SLGP stimulation to slow the SR and the mean values of frequency and amplitude of ARGP neural activity compared with the SHAM group (all P < 0.05).

abstract = {We investigated cardiac autonomic function in 16 patients with panic disorder before and after treatment with paroxetine using Holter ECG records. Our previous data suggest a relative increase in sympathetic activity in patients with panic disorder, especially during sleep. Data for 20 h and awake and sleep periods were analyzed using spectral analysis to quantify absolute and relative heart period variability in ultra low (ULF: < 0.0033 Hz), very low (VLF: 0.0033-0.04 Hz), low (LF: 0.04-0.15 Hz) and high (HF: 0.15-0.5 Hz) frequency bands. We also obtained fractal dimensions (FD) for the 20-hour, awake and sleep time series of RR intervals. Paroxetine treatment (19.7 + 4.7 mg/day for 105 + 37 days) resulted in a significant improvement in the frequency and intensity of panic attacks and also on the state anxiety inventory. Paroxetine treatment produced a significant decrease of 20-hour absolute HF power, awake absolute LF power and sleep absolute HF power. There was also a significant decrease of FDs after treatment with paroxetine for the sleep period. The decrease in LF and HF powers, and sleep FD is likely due to the antimuscarinic effect of paroxetine.

Mechanistic links between the brain and the heart have been explored in detail over the past several decades, and catecholamine excess, neuroendocrine dysfunction, and unchecked inflammation all likely contribute to the pathophysiologic process. Although cardiac dysfunction has also been described in other disease paradigms, including septic shock and thermal injury, there is likely a common underlying pathophysiology. In this review, we will examine the pathophysiology of cardiac dysfunction after neurologic injury, discuss the evidence surrounding cardiac dysfunction after different neurologic injuries, and suggest future research goals to gain knowledge and improve outcomes in this patient population.},

@article{Aras2018,
abstract = {BACKGROUND Abnormal QT intervals, long QT or short QT, have been epidemiologically linked with sudden cardiac death because of ventricular fibrillation (VF). Consequently, Food and Drug Administration recommends testing all pharmacological agents for QT toxicity as a risk factor for cardiac toxicity. Such tests assess QT/QTc interval, which represents ventricular depolarization and repolarization. However, the current QT toxicity analysis does not account for the well-known anisotropy in cardiac tissue conductivity. Mines demonstrated in 1913 that cardiac wavelength ($\lambda$) determines inducibility of reentrant arrhythmia, where both repolarization time or action potential duration and conduction velocity determine $\lambda$=action potential duration×conduction velocity. We aimed to determine the role of anisotropic wavelength in inducibility of VF in explanted human left ventricular preparations. We tested the hypothesis that 3-dimensional cardiac wavelength, which takes into account anisotropic cardiac tissue conductivity, can accurately predict VF sustainability. METHODS We conducted panoramic optical mapping of coronary perfused human left ventricular wedge preparations subjected to pharmacologically induced shortening and prolongation of action potential duration, by IK,ATP agonist pinacidil and antagonist glybenclamide, respectively. This measured action potential duration, conduction velocity, and thus determined pacing cycle length-dependent wavelengths in longitudinal ($\lambda$L), transverse ($\lambda$TV), and transmural ($\lambda$TM) directions using S1S1 pacing protocol, from which wavelength volume (V$\lambda$) was determined, as V$\lambda$=$\lambda$L×$\lambda$TV×$\lambda$TM, and compared with tissue volume. We tested a hypothesis that tissue volume/V$\lambda$ ratio can predict VF sustainability. RESULTS At baseline, at pacing rate of 240 beats per minute, the wavelengths were $\lambda$L=9.6±0.6 cm, $\lambda$TV=4.2±0.3 cm, and $\lambda$TM=5.8±0.2 cm, respectively (n=7), and thus V$\lambda$=246.4±42.1 cm3. Administration of pinacidil at escalating concentrations progressively decreased V$\lambda$, and VF became sustained, when tissue volume/V$\lambda$ was above safety factor $\kappa$=4.4±0.6 (n=9) during rapid pacing. Treatment with glybenclamide decreased VT/V$\lambda$ below $\kappa$ at any pacing rate and prevented VF sustainability. CONCLUSIONS Sustained VF was only sustained in ventricular volume exceeding critical V$\lambda$=$\lambda$L×$\lambda$TV×$\lambda$TM.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 The Authors. Modulation of human cardiac mechanical and electrophysiologic function by direct s tellate ganglion stimulation has not been performed. Our aim was to assess the effect of low-level left stellate ganglion (LSG) stimulation (SGS) on arrhythmias, hemodynamic, and cardiac electrophysiological indices. Patients undergoing ablation procedures for arrhythmias were recruited for SGS. A stimulating electrode was placed next to the LSG under fluoroscopy and ultrasound imaging; and SGS (5–10 Hz, 10–20 mA) was performed. We measured hemodynamic, intracardiac and ECG parameters, and activation recovery intervals (ARIs) (surrogate for action potential duration) from a duodecapolar catheter in the right ventricular outflow tract. Five patients underwent SGS (3 males, 45 ± 20 years). Stimulating catheter placement was successful, and without complication in all patients. SGS did not change heart rate, but increased mean arterial blood pressure (78 ± 3 mmHg to 98 ± 5 mmHg, P < 0.001) and dP/dt max (1148 ± 244 mmHg/sec to 1645 ± 493 mmHg/sec, P = 0.03). SGS shortened mean ARI from 304 ± 23 msec to 283 ± 17 msec (P < 0.001), although one patient required parasympathetic blockade. Dispersion of repolarization (DOR) increased in four patients and decreased in one, consistent with animal models. QT interval, T-wave duration and amplitude at baseline and with SGS were 415 ± 15 msec versus 399 ± 15 msec (P < 0.001); 201 ± 12 msec versus 230 ± 28 msec; and 0.2 ± 0.09 mV versus 0.22 ± 0.08 mV, respectively. At the level of SGS performed, no increase in arrhythmias was seen. Percutaneous low-level SGS shortens ARI in the RVOT, and increases blood pressure and LV contractility. These observations demonstrate feasibility of percutaneous SGS in humans.},

abstract = {Importance Depression has been associated with poorer medical outcomes in acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but there are few data on the effects of antidepressant treatment on long-term prognosis. Objective To investigate the effect on long-term major adverse cardiac events (MACE) of escitalopram treatment of depression in patients with recent ACS. Design, Setting, and Participants Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted among 300 patients with recent ACS and depression enrolled from May 2007 to March 2013, with follow-up completed in June 2017, at Chonnam National University Hospital, Gwangju, South Korea. Interventions Patients were randomly assigned to receive either escitalopram in flexible dosages of 5, 10, 15, or 20 mg/d (n = 149) or matched placebo (n = 151) for 24 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was MACE, a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Four secondary outcomes were the individual MACE components of all-cause mortality, cardiac death, MI, and PCI. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare the escitalopram and placebo groups by time to first MACE. Results Among 300 randomized patients (mean age, 60 years; 119 women [39.3%]), 100% completed a median of 8.1 (interquartile range, 7.5-9.0) years of follow-up. MACE occurred in 61 patients (40.9%) receiving escitalopram and in 81 (53.6%) receiving placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95% CI, 0.49-0.96;P = .03). Comparing individual MACE outcomes between the escitalopram and placebo groups, respectively, incidences for all-cause mortality were 20.8% vs 24.5% (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.51-1.33;P = .43), for cardiac death, 10.7% vs 13.2% (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.41-1.52;P = .48); for MI, 8.7% vs 15.2% (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.27-0.96;P = .04), and for PCI, 12.8% vs 19.9% (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.33-1.04;P = .07). Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with depression following recent acute coronary syndrome, 24-week treatment with escitalopram compared with placebo resulted in a lower risk of major adverse cardiac events after a median of 8.1 years. Further research is needed to assess the generalizability of these findings. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT00419471},

@article{Hong2010,
abstract = {The BAR domain protein superfamily is involved in membrane invagination and endocytosis, but its role in organizing membrane proteins has not been explored. In particular, the membrane scaffolding protein BIN1 functions to initiate T-tubule genesis in skeletal muscle cells. Constitutive knockdown of BIN1 in mice is perinatal lethal, which is associated with an induced dilated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. However, the functional role of BIN1 in cardiomyocytes is not known. An important function of cardiac T-tubules is to allow L-type calcium channels (Cav1.2) to be in close proximity to sarcoplasmic reticulum-based ryanodine receptors to initiate the intracellular calcium transient. Efficient excitation-contraction (EC) coupling and normal cardiac contractility depend upon Cav1.2 localization to T-tubules. We hypothesized that BIN1 not only exists at cardiac T-tubules, but it also localizes Cav1.2 to these membrane structures. We report that BIN1 localizes to cardiac T-tubules and clusters there with Cav1.2. Studies involve freshly acquired human and mouse adult cardiomyocytes using complementary immunocytochemistry, electron microscopy with dual immunogold labeling, and co-immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, we use surface biotinylation and live cell confocal and total internal fluorescence microscopy imaging in cardiomyocytes and cell lines to explore delivery of Cav1.2 to BIN1 structures. We find visually and quantitatively that dynamic microtubules are tethered to membrane scaffolded by BIN1, allowing targeted delivery of Cav1.2 from the microtubules to the associated membrane. Since Cav1.2 delivery to BIN1 occurs in reductionist non-myocyte cell lines, we find that other myocyte-specific structures are not essential and there is an intrinsic relationship between microtubule-based Cav1.2 delivery and its BIN1 scaffold. In differentiated mouse cardiomyocytes, knockdown of BIN1 reduces surface Cav1.2 and delays development of the calcium transient, indicating that Cav1.2 targeting to BIN1 is functionally important to cardiac calcium signaling. We have identified that membrane-associated BIN1 not only induces membrane curvature but can direct specific antegrade delivery of microtubule-transported membrane proteins. Furthermore, this paradigm provides a microtubule and BIN1-dependent mechanism of Cav1.2 delivery to T-tubules. This novel Cav1.2 trafficking pathway should serve as an important regulatory aspect of EC coupling, affecting cardiac contractility in mammalian hearts.},

abstract = {Metrics of heart period variability are widely used in the behavioral and biomedical sciences, although somewhat confusingly labeled as heart rate variability (HRV). Despite their wide use, HRV metrics are usually analyzed and interpreted without reference to prevailing levels of cardiac chronotropic state (i.e., mean heart rate or mean heart period). This isolated treatment of HRV metrics is nontrivial. All HRV metrics routinely used in the literature exhibit a known and positive relationship with the mean duration of the interval between two beats (heart period): as the heart period increases, so does its variability. This raises the question of whether HRV metrics should be “corrected” for the mean heart period (or its inverse, the heart rate). Here, we outline biological, quantitative, and interpretive issues engendered by this question. We provide arguments that HRV is neither uniformly nor simply a surrogate for heart period. We also identify knowledge gaps that remain to be satisfactorily addressed with respect to assumptions underlying existing HRV correction approaches. In doing so, we aim to stimulate further progress toward the rigorous use and disciplined interpretation of HRV. We close with provisional guidance on HRV reporting that acknowledges the complex interplay between the mean and variability of the heart period.},

abstract = {Diminished heart rate variability is associated with high sympathetic tone and an increased mortality rate in heart failure cases. We constructed Poincar{\'{e}} plots of each sinus R-R interval plotted against the subsequent R-R interval from 24-hour Holter recordings of 24 healthy subjects (control group) and 24 patients with heart failure. Every subject in the control group had a comet-shaped Poincar{\'{e}} plot resulting from an increase in beat-to-beat dispersion as heart rate slowed. No patient with heart failure had this comet-shaped pattern. Instead, three distinctive patterns were identified: (1) a torpedo-shaped pattern resulting from low R-R interval dispersion over the entire range of heart rates, (2) a fanshaped pattern resulting from restriction of overall R-R interval ranges with enhanced dispersion, and (3) complex patterns with clusters of points characteristic of stepwise changes in R-R intervals. Poincar{\'{e}} pattern could not be predicted from standard deviations of R-R intervals. This first use of Poincar{\'{e}} plots in heart rate variability analysis reveals a complexity not readily perceived from standard deviation information. Further study is warranted to determine if this method will allow refined assessment of cardiac-autonomic integrity in heart failure, which could help identify patients at highest risk for sudden death. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied eight patients presenting with TTC diagnosed by coronary angiography, ventriculography, magnetic resonance imaging, and echocardiography. Serial myocardial biopsies were taken during the phase of severely impaired left ventricular function and after functional recovery. Specimens were examined by light and electron microscope as well as immunohistochemistry. Additionally, specific methods detecting different types of cell death and measurements of virus titer were performed. All patients showed the typical contractile pattern of TTC and complete functional recovery within 12 +/- 3 days. In 'acute' biopsies, many vacuoles of different size were found contributing to cellular hypertrophy. PAS staining revealed intracellular accumulation of glycogen. Additionally, structural deteriorations characterized by disorganization of contractile and cytoskeletal proteins could be detected. The extracellular matrix proteins were increased. Signs of oncotic and apoptotic cell death were absent. After functional recovery, all described alterations showed a nearly complete reversibility. CONCLUSION: TTC is accompanied by severe morphological alterations potentially resulting from catecholamine excess followed by microcirculatory dysfunction and direct cardiotoxicity. However, the affected myocardium represents a high potential of structural reconstitution which correlates with the rapid functional recovery.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Depression is an adverse prognostic factor after an acute myocardial infarction (MI), and an increased propensity toward emotionally-driven myocardial ischemia may play a role. We aimed to examine the association between depressive symptoms and mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia in young survivors of an MI.\n\nMETHODS: We studied 98 patients (49 women and 49 men) age 38-60 years who were hospitalized for acute MI in the previous 6 months. Patients underwent myocardial perfusion imaging at rest, after mental stress (speech task), and after exercise or pharmacological stress. A summed difference score (SDS), obtained with observer-independent software, was used to quantify myocardial ischemia under both stress conditions. The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) was used to measure depressive symptoms, which were analyzed as overall score, and as separate somatic and cognitive depressive symptom scores.\n\nRESULTS: There was a significant positive association between depressive symptoms and SDS with mental stress, denoting more ischemia. After adjustment for demographic and lifestyle factors, disease severity and medications, each incremental depressive symptom was associated with 0.14 points higher SDS. When somatic and cognitive depressive symptoms were examined separately, both somatic [$\beta$ = 0.17, 95% CI: (0.04, 0.30), p = 0.01] and cognitive symptoms [$\beta$ = 0.31, 95% CI: (0.07, 0.56), p = 0.01] were significantly associated with mental stress-induced ischemia. Depressive symptoms were not associated with ischemia induced by exercise or pharmacological stress.\n\nCONCLUSION: Among young post-MI patients, higher levels of both cognitive and somatic depressive symptoms are associated with a higher propensity to develop myocardial ischemia with mental stress, but not with physical (exercise or pharmacological) stress.},

abstract = {The mouse heart is a popular model to study the function and autonomic control of the specialized cardiac conduction system (CCS). However, the precise identity and anatomical distribution of the intrinsic cardiac nerves that modulate the function of the mouse CCS have not been adequately studied. We aimed at determining the organization and distribution of the intrinsic cardiac nerves that supply the CCS of the mouse. In whole mouse heart preparations, intrinsic neural structures were revealed by histochemical staining for acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Adrenergic, cholinergic and peptidergic neural components were identified, respectively, by immunohistochemical labeling for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), substance P (SP), and protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5). Myocytes of the CCS were identified by immunolabeling of hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide-gated potassium channel 4 (HCN4). In addition, the presence of CCS myocytes in atypical locations was verified using fluorescent immunohistochemistry performed on routine paraffin sections. The results demonstrate that four microscopic epicardial nerves orientated toward the sinuatrial nodal (SAN) region derive from both the dorsal right atrial and right ventral nerve subplexuses. The atrioventricular nodal (AVN) region is typically supplied by a single intrinsic nerve derived from the left dorsal nerve subplexus at the posterior interatrial groove. SAN myocytes positive for HCN4 were widely distributed both on the medial, anterior, lateral and even posterior sides of the root of the right cranial (superior caval) vein. The distribution of HCN4-positive myocytes in the AVN region was also wider than previously considered. HCN4-positive cells and thin slivers of the AVN extended to the roots of the ascending aorta, posteriorly to the orifice of the coronary sinus, and even along both atrioventricular rings. Notwithstanding the fact that cholinergic nerve fibers and axons clearly predominate in the mouse CCS, adrenergic nerve fibers and axons are abundant therein as well. Altogether, these results provide new insight into the anatomical basis of the neural control of the mouse CCS.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiac stress testing, particularly with imaging, has been the focus of debates about rising health care costs, inappropriate use, and patient safety in the context of radiation exposure.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To determine whether U.S. trends in cardiac stress test use may be attributable to population shifts in demographics, risk factors, and provider characteristics and evaluate whether racial/ethnic disparities exist in physician decision making.\n\nDESIGN: Analyses of repeated cross-sectional data.\n\nSETTING: National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (1993 to 2010).\n\nPATIENTS: Adults without coronary heart disease.\n\nMEASUREMENTS: Cardiac stress test referrals and inappropriate use.\n\nRESULTS: Between 1993 to 1995 and 2008 to 2010, the annual number of U.S. ambulatory visits in which a cardiac stress test was ordered or performed increased from 28 per 10,000 visits to 45 per 10,000 visits. No trend was found toward more frequent testing after adjustment for patient characteristics, risk factors, and provider characteristics (P = 0.134). Cardiac stress tests with imaging comprised a growing portion of all tests, increasing from 59% in 1993 to 1995 to 87% in 2008 to 2010. At least 34.6% were probably inappropriate, with associated annual costs and harms of $501 million and 491 future cases of cancer. Authors found no evidence of a lower likelihood of black patients receiving a cardiac stress test (odds ratio, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.21]) than white patients, although some evidence of disparity in Hispanic patients was found (odds ratio, 0.75 [CI, 0.55 to 1.02]).\n\nLIMITATION: Cross-sectional design with limited clinical data.\n\nCONCLUSION: National growth in cardiac stress test use can largely be explained by population and provider characteristics, but use of imaging cannot. Physician decision making about cardiac stress test use does not seem to contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in cardiovascular disease.\n\nPRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences.},

abstract = {Arrhythmic sudden cardiac death (SCD) may be caused by ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation or pulseless electric activity/asystole. Effective risk stratification to identify patients at risk of arrhythmic SCD is essential for targeting our healthcare and research resources to tackle this important public health issue. Although our understanding of SCD because of pulseless electric activity/asystole is growing, the overwhelming majority of research in risk stratification has focused on SCD-ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation. This review focuses on existing and novel risk stratification tools for SCD-ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation. For patients with left ventricular dysfunction or myocardial infarction, advances in imaging, measures of cardiac autonomic function, and measures of repolarization have shown considerable promise in refining risk. Yet the majority of SCD-ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation occurs in patients without known cardiac disease. Biomarkers and novel imaging techniques may provide further risk stratification in the general population beyond traditional risk stratification for coronary artery disease alone. Despite these advances, significant challenges in risk stratification remain that must be overcome before a meaningful impact on SCD can be realized.},

Cases had significantly (p less than 0.05) lower hematocrits, fewer platelets, and more band cells on arrival, than did controls. Cases also had lower serum phosphorous, magnesium, potassium, iron and alkaline phosphatase levels, and increased bilirubin and aspartate aminotransferase levels relative to controls. Based on the results of multivariable logistic regression, hematocrit, platelet numbers, serum phosphorous, iron and aspartate aminotransferase levels were the most significant parameters for the prediction of respiratory disease. Reference values for stressed feedlot calves were created. Most parameters were distributed in an approximately normal manner, however the group to group variation in most parameters was significant.},

Here we targeted mental fatigability (MF) as a determinant of altered high frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) reactivity in individuals with MCI, and examined frontobasal ganglia circuitry as a neural basis supporting the link between MF and HF-HRV reactivity. Methods We measured mental fatigability and HF-HRV during a 60-minute cognitive stress protocol in 19 individuals with MCI. HF-HRV responses were modeled using a quadratic equation. Resting state functional connectivity of intra- and inter-network frontobasal ganglia circuitry was assessed using blood-oxygen-level-dependent magnetic resonance imaging among seven of the participants. Results Lower MF was associated with faster and greater rebound in U-shape HF-HRV reactivity, which linked to a stronger connectivity between right middle frontal gyrus and left putamen. Conclusions Results suggest that MF may contribute to abnormal physiological stress regulation in MCI, and fronto basal ganglia circuitry may support the link.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Depression is an established risk factor for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), with an impact on cardiac prognosis; nonetheless, the literature disagrees on the role played by anxiety. No study has evaluated this relationship in a cardiac population with no history of depression and after their first diagnosis of ACS. The aim of this study is to explore these associations without the confounding role of long-lasting heart disease or psychiatric illnesses. METHOD Two hundred sixty-six patients with no history of depression completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorder at baseline and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months follow-up after their first diagnosis of ACS. During the follow-up period, we collected information regarding the major adverse cardiac events. RESULTS Developing a first-ever depressive episode, in a proportional hazard model, was associated with almost 3 times the risk of a recurrent cardiac event (odds ratio = 2.590, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.321, 5.078], p = .006). Furthermore, a moderation analysis revealed that increasing levels of baseline anxiety had opposing effects on cardiac outcomes, being protective only in those who did not develop incident depression (B = -0.0824, 95% CI [-0.164, -0.005], p = .048). No dose-response effect between depressive or anxious symptoms and cardiac outcomes emerged. CONCLUSION Our results confirm the detrimental effect of depression on cardiac prognosis in a selected population and suggest that anxiety after the first diagnosis of ACS might have different roles depending on the illness' course.

abstract = {Background: Recent studies have shown that depressive disorder is associated with impaired baroreceptor or baroreflex sensitivity, which is proposed to be a predisposing factor for sudden death in patients with manifest cardiac disease. These studies have not evaluated the afferent and efferent components of the cardiac baroreflex loop or other baroreflex mechanisms that regulate target processes (cardiac metabolism and blood pressure variability) related to the impairment. The objective of this study was to gain more insight into autonomic functioning in depressive disorder to more fully examine the potential basis for increased cardiac mortality. Methods: The subjects were 28 women and men with unipolar major depression who were taking antidepressant medications and who were in partial remission and free of cardiovascular or other serious disease, and 28 healthy control subjects matched for sex, age, and ethnicity. The two samples were compared for negative affective dispositions (anger expression, hostility, defensiveness, anxiety), spontaneous (closed-loop) baroreflex activity, heart rate, heart rate variability, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate-systolic blood pressure double product under resting conditions. Results: Depressed patients showed a general disposition to anger suppression coupled with higher hostility and anxiety, and lower defensiveness. The patients showed higher general sympathetic activity (high levels of blood pressure, low-frequency heart rate variability) and lower parasympathetic-related activity (high heart rate and reduced high frequency heart rate variability) with affected cardiac metabolism estimated by the double product. Depressed patients had lower baroreflex sensitivity related to a higher gain of the afferent component of the baroreflex without respective gain adjustment of its efferent component (reflex gain 'de-afferentation'). It was coupled with a compensatory higher number of effective baroreflex reactions (reflex gating 're-afferentation'). Antidepressant agents and depressed mood had additional independent effects on baroreflex sensitivity through the efferent component of the cardiac baroreflex loop. Conclusions: The data indicate that different baroreflex components and mechanisms may be impaired in patients with depression and may contribute to their increased cardiac risk. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {KEY POINTS Cardiac sympathetic afferents are considered to be essential pathways for transmission of cardiac nociception to the central nervous system during myocardial ischaemia. However, a potential contribution of the CSAR control of cardiac dysfunction in both normal and chronic heart failure (CHF) states remains unknown. We found that activation of the CSAR evokes little increase in cardiac contractility with an exaggerated peripheral vasoconstriction in the CHF state. CSAR inhibition by epicardial lidocaine decreased cardiac contractility to a greater extent in CHF rats than sham rats. Furthermore, we also found that epicardial lidocaine paradoxically decreased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and left ventricular end-diastolic volume (preload) in CHF rats, which was not observed in sham rats. Chronic ablation of the CSAR by epicardial application of the afferent neurotoxin, RTX, selectively lowered diastolic blood pressure CHF rats. The observation suggests that CSAR has a differential effect on cardiac function in normal and CHF states. CSAR activation in normal state causes significant increase in cardiac contractility and cardiac output. ABSTRACT The enhanced 'cardiac sympathetic afferent reflex' (CSAR) critically contributes to the exaggerated global sympathetic tone in chronic heart failure (CHF). However, a potential contribution of the cardio-cardiac reflex control of cardiac function in both normal and CHF states remains unknown. In this study, we evaluated the effects of direct activation or inhibition of the CSAR on cardiac function by pressure-volume (P-V) loop analysis in ∼12-week sham-operated and myocardial infarcted (MI) rats. In sham rats, acute CSAR activation by epicardial application of bradykinin (BK) increased heart rate (HR), left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), the maximum first derivative of left ventricular pressure (dp/dtmax ), and the slope of the end-systolic P-V relationship (ESPVR), suggesting that acute CSAR activation in the normal state enhances myocardial contractility. CSAR activation also decreased left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic volumes with little effect on LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) or the end-diastolic P-V relationship (EDPVR) in sham rats. Compared to sham, CHF rats exhibit a reduced increase in the slope of the ESPVR and dp/dtmax in response to BK, indicating a poor contractile response to CSAR activation. Interestingly, BK application in CHF rats increased cardiac systolic and diastolic volumes and further increased the elevated LVEDP, neither of which was seen in sham rats. Following CSAR inhibition by epicardial lidocaine, blood pressure, HR, LVSP, dp/dt, LVEDP and ESPVR decreased in CHF rats whereas lidocaine had little effect in sham rats, indicating that the CSAR is tonically active in CHF and contributes to cardiac dysfunction. Furthermore, we found that epicardial lidocaine paradoxically decreased LV end-diastolic volume (preload) in CHF rats, which was not observed in sham rats. The decreased preload by lidocaine in CHF rats may be due to a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance since epicardial lidocaine significantly lowered peripheral (renal) sympathetic nerve activity in CHF rats but not in sham rats. Furthermore, chronic ablation of CSAR by epicardial application of a selective afferent neurotoxin, resiniferatoxin, selectively lowered diastolic blood pressure both at daytime and night-time with less effect on systolic blood pressure in CHF rats. Our data suggest that there is an imbalance between cardiac and peripheral responses to CSAR in CHF animals compared to sham-operated controls.},

abstract = {We evaluated a method of baroreflex testing involving sequential intravenous bolus injections of nitroprusside followed by phenylephrine and phenylephrine followed by nitroprusside in 18 healthy men and women, and we drew inferences regarding human sympathetic and vagal baroreflex mechanisms. We recorded the electrocardiogram, photoplethysmographic finger arterial pressure, and peroneal nerve muscle sympathetic activity. We then contrasted least squares linear regression slopes derived from the depressor (nitroprusside) and pressor (phenylephrine) phases with 1) slopes derived from spontaneous fluctuations of systolic arterial pressures and R-R intervals, and 2) baroreflex gain derived from cross-spectral analyses of systolic pressures and R-R intervals. We calculated sympathetic baroreflex gain from integrated muscle sympathetic nerve activity and diastolic pressures. We found that vagal baroreflex slopes are less when arterial pressures are falling than when they are rising and that this hysteresis exists over pressure ranges both below and above baseline levels. Although pharmacological and spontaneous vagal baroreflex responses correlate closely, pharmacological baroreflex slopes tend to be lower than those derived from spontaneous fluctuations. Sympathetic baroreflex slopes are similar when arterial pressure is falling and rising; however, small pressure elevations above baseline silence sympathetic motoneurons. Vagal, but not sympathetic baroreflex gains vary inversely with subjects' ages and their baseline arterial pressures. There is no correlation between sympathetic and vagal baroreflex gains. We recommend repeated sequential nitroprusside followed by phenylephrine doses as a simple, efficientmeans to provoke and characterize human vagal and sympathetic baroreflex responses.},

abstract = {Despite promising results in clinical trials conducted to date, little is known about how cardiac contractile modulation (CCM) mediated inotropic enhancement occurs and how CCM affects the electrophysiological characteristics of the heart. The aims of the present study were to 1) investigate how the stimulation parameters of the CCM signal and the location of stimulus delivery influence the contractile response, 2) characterise the effect of CCM on ventricular electrophysiology, and 3) investigate the potential physiological mechanisms underlying these acute inotropic and electrophysiological effects. Experiments were conducted in isolated rabbit hearts with simultaneous measurement of ventricular contractility and monophasic action potential duration (MAPD). Biphasic square wave pulses were applied to the left ventricle, timed to coincide with the absolute refractory period. CCM mediated responses were assessed over a range of signal amplitudes (2-30. mA), durations (2-15. ms) and delays from the activation of the locally recorded monophasic action potential (0-30. ms). Responses were assessed during Perfusion With The $\beta$1-adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol (1.8 $\mu$M) and HMR 1556 (500. nM), an inhibitor of the slow delayed rectifying potassium current. Norepinephrine content was collected and assessed by ELISA from samples of coronary effluent collected during CCM. CCM induced a significant increase in left ventricular pressure (LVP) in a manner dependent upon the amplitude and duration of the CCM signal but independent of the delay of the stimulus within the action potential plateau and was associated with an increase in norepinephrine in coronary effluent (Mean: 46 ± 9. pg/ml). CCM promoted a shortening of MAPD-90% close to the site of stimulation (-19 ± 3%) but had no effect on those recorded at distant sites (0 ± 1%). The increase in LVP (4.7 ± 1.8 vs. 0.7 ± 0.9%, P< 0.01) and shortening of local MAPD-90% (-15 ± 3 vs. 1 ± 1%, P< 0.01) was abolished with metoprolol. Perfusion with HMR 1556 caused a significant inhibition of local MAPD shortening (-27 ± 2 vs. -21 ± 3. ms, P< 0.05). CCM is associated with a shortening of ventricular MAPD in a manner dependent upon $\beta$-adrenoceptor stimulation resulting from catecholamine release, a finding which may be of clinical significance in regard to the development of malignant ventricular arrhythmias.

abstract = {Routine stress monitoring in daily life can predict potentially serious health impacts. Effective stress monitoring in medical and healthcare fields is dependent upon accurate determination of stress-related features. In this study, we determined the optimal stress-related features for effective monitoring of cumulative stress. We first investigated the effects of short- and long-term stress on various heart rate variability (HRV) features using a rodent model. Subsequently, we determined an optimal HRV feature set using support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE). Experimental results indicate that the HRV time domain features generally decrease under long-term stress, and the HRV frequency domain features have substantially significant differences under short-term stress. Further, an SVM classifier with a radial basis function kernel proved most accurate (93.11%) when using an optimal HRV feature set comprising the mean of R-R intervals (mRR), the standard deviation of R-R intervals (SDRR), and the coefficient of variance of R-R intervals (CVRR) as time domain features, and the normalized low frequency (nLF) and the normalized high frequency (nHF) as frequency domain features. Our findings indicate that the optimal HRV features identified in this study can effectively and efficiently detect stress. This knowledge facilitates development of in-facility and mobile healthcare system designs to support stress monitoring in daily life.},

abstract = {AIM: Short-term psychological stress is associated with an immediate physiological response and may be associated with a transiently higher risk of cardiovascular events. The aim of this study was to determine whether brief episodes of anger trigger the onset of acute myocardial infarction (MI), acute coronary syndromes (ACS), ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke, and ventricular arrhythmia.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a systematic review of studies evaluating whether outbursts of anger are associated with the short-term risk of heart attacks, strokes, and disturbances in cardiac rhythm that occur in everyday life. We performed a literature search of the CINAHL, Embase, PubMed, and PsycINFO databases from January 1966 to June 2013 and reviewed the reference lists of retrieved articles and included meeting abstracts and unpublished results from experts in the field. Incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated with inverse-variance-weighted random-effect models. The systematic review included nine independent case-crossover studies of anger outbursts and MI/ACS (four studies), ischaemic stroke (two studies), ruptured intracranial aneurysm (one study), and ventricular arrhythmia (two studies). There was evidence of substantial heterogeneity between the studies (I(2) = 92.5% for MI/ACS and 89.8% for ischaemic stroke). Despite the heterogeneity, all studies found that, compared with other times, there was a higher rate of cardiovascular events in the 2h following outbursts of anger.\n\nCONCLUSION: There is a higher risk of cardiovascular events shortly after outbursts of anger.},

First, we present data indicating the functional importance of presynaptic and postsynaptic vagal modulation of adrenergic neurotransmission on electrical activity in sinus and A-V nodes, and contractile activity of canine cardiac Purkinje fibers. Second, we indicate the possible intraventricular adrenergic and vagal pathways to the ventricles, suggesting that sympathetic fibers travel in the epicardium while vagal fibers appear to cross the A-V groove in the epicardium but then take an intramural route for part of their course. Finally, we demonstrate that a lesion such as a myocardial infarction can interrupt neural fibers traveling through the infarction to affect noninfarcted myocardium distal to the infarction. These factors may play a role in the genesis of some cardiac arrhythmias.},

abstract = {Background-Among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), depression is both common and underrecognized. The association of different manifestations of depression, somatic and cognitive, with depression recognition and long-term prognosis is poorly understood. Methods and Results-Depression was confirmed in 481 AMI patients enrolled from 21 sites during their index hospitalization with a Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score ≥10. Within the PHQ-9, separate somatic and cognitive symptom scores were derived, and the independent association between these domains and the clinical recognition of depression, as documented in the medical records, was evaluated. In a separate multisite AMI registry of 2347 patients, the association between somatic and cognitive depressive symptoms and 4-year all-cause mortality and 1-year all-cause rehospitalization was evaluated. Depression was clinically recognized in 29% (n=140) of patients. Cognitive depressive symptoms (relative risk per SD increase, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.26; P≥0.01) were independently associated with depression recognition, whereas the association for somatic symptoms and recognition (relative risk, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.26; P=0.66) was not significant. However, unadjusted Cox regression analyses found that only somatic depressive symptoms were associated with 4-year mortality (hazard ratio [HR] per SD increase, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.39) or 1-year rehospitalization (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.33), whereas cognitive manifestations were not (HR for mortality, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.14; HR for rehospitalization, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.11). After multivariable adjustment, the association between somatic symptoms and rehospitalization persisted (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.27; P=0.01) but was attenuated for mortality (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.21; P=0.30). Conclusions-Depression after AMI was recognized in fewer than 1 in 3 patients. Although cognitive symptoms were associated with recognition of depression, somatic symptoms were associa ed with long-term outcomes. Comprehensive screening and treatment of both somatic and cognitive symptoms may be necessary to optimize depression recognition and treatment in AMI patients.

Recognition and analysis of such links in the pathogenesis of malignant cardiac arrhythmia are emphasized in this review. Neurocardiac links have been shown to produce arrhythmia both experimentally and clinically; specific examples, including stroke, epilepsy, and environmental stress are presented. We hypothesize that the individual with a diseased heart has a greater likelihood of experiencing cardiac arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death when the neurocardiac axis is activated. Reviewing possible mechanisms of brain-related arrhythmias, we suggest that the nervous system directs the events leading to cardiac damage by raising catecholamine levels and potentially inducing arrhythmia.},

abstract = {Prior studies have suggested that, compared with angiographic, exercise electrocardiographic, and clinical data in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD), the data provided by exercise thallium-201 scintigraphy are the best predictor of cardiac events. The most consistent finding is that the presence and extent of jeopardized viable myocardium, manifest by transient thallium-201 defects, predicts cardiac events. In addition, a normal thallium-201 scan reliably predicts an annual event rate for cardiac death or nonfatal myocardial infarction of < 1% per year, a rate approaching that of a normal aged-matched population. Further, it has been demonstrated that the incremental prognostic value of transient thallium-201 defects is statistically significant and nearly double that of clinical data and stress electrocardiography combined, and, importantly, not significantly different from that obtained by adding angiographic data. These results appear to hold for the newer, technetium-99m-based perfusion agents such as sestamibi, for which sensitivity and specificity for detecting CAD are comparable. Stress echocardiography, which depends on development of a secondary phenomenon (abnormal wall motion), appears to be less sensitive for the detection of CAD than myocardial perfusion imaging (which can detect the primary insult, hypoperfusion); stress echocardiography is also less sensitive for detection of jeopardized viable myocardium. Because of its lower sensitivity for detecting jeopardized viable myocardium, stress echocardiography may underestimate the risk of cardiac events, especially in patients with known CAD. Thus it may not reliably identify a low-risk group, especially in patients with known CAD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {AIMS: Prospective studies have shown that social isolation (i.e. lack of social contacts) predicts incident coronary heart disease (CHD), but it is unclear whether it predicts incident heart failure (HF) and what factors might mediate this association. HF patients may be more susceptible to social isolation as they tend to be older and may have disrupted social relationships due to life course factors (e.g. retirement or bereavement). We prospectively examined whether individuals with higher vs. low social isolation have a higher incidence of HF and determined whether this association is mediated by vital exhaustion.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We estimated incident HF hospitalization or death among 14 348 participants from Visit 2 (1990-1992) in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study using Cox proportional hazard models which were sequentially adjusted for age, race/study community, gender, current smoking, alcohol use, and co-morbidities. We conducted mediation analyses according to the Baron and Kenny method. After a median follow-up of 16.9 person-years, 1727 (13.0%) incident HF events occurred. The adjusted hazard of incident HF was greater for those in the higher vs. low social isolation risk group (hazard ratio 1.21, 95% confidence interval 1.08-1.35). Our data suggest that vital exhaustion strongly mediates the association between higher social isolation and incident HF (the percentage change in beta coefficient for higher vs. low social isolation groups after adjusting for vital exhaustion was 36%).\n\nCONCLUSION: These data suggest that greater social isolation is an independent risk factor for incident HF, and this association appears to be strongly mediated by vital exhaustion.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Young women with coronary heart disease have high rates of depression and a higher risk of adverse events than men of similar age. Whether depression has a higher prognostic value in this group than in men and older women is not known. Our objective was to assess whether depression in young women is associated with higher risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and adverse outcomes compared with similarly aged men and older women. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined 3237 patients undergoing coronary angiography for evaluation of CAD and followed them for 2.9 years (median). Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9, and CAD burden was dichotomized based on its presence or absence. After multivariable adjustment for CAD risk factors, depressive symptoms predicted CAD presence in women aged ≤ 55 years (odds ratio=1.07 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02 to 1.13 per 1 point increase in PHQ-9 score), but not in men aged ≤ 55 years or women aged >55 years. Depressive symptoms also predicted increased risk of death in women aged ≤ 55 years (adjusted hazard ratio=1.07, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.14, per 1 point increase in PHQ-9 score), but not in men aged ≤ 55 years and women aged >55 years, with P=0.02 for the depression-sex interaction and P=0.02 for depression-sex-age interaction. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with suspected or established CAD, depressive symptoms are associated with increased risk of death, particularly in young women. This group may be especially vulnerable to the adverse cardiovascular effects of depression.},

Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA, quantified by high-frequency HR variability) were assessed as measures of sympathetic and parasympathetic cardiovascular activity, respectively. A mediation model was calculated to test the indirect effects of ACEs on HR via SBP and RSA. RESULTS The effect of ACEs on HR reactivity was mediated by SBP reactivity but not by RSA reactivity. ACEs were associated with reduced SBP at rest. CONCLUSIONS ACEs were associated with down-regulation in a measure of sympathetic but no alteration in a measure of parasympathetic cardiovascular stress reactivity in adulthood.

abstract = {Rationale: Leucocyte telomere length (LTL) is a biological marker of aging, and shorter LTL is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Reduced regenerative capacity has been proposed as a mechanism. Bone marrow-derived circulating progenitor cells (PCs) are involved in tissue repair and regeneration. Objective: To examine the relationship between LTL and PCs, and their impact on adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Methods and Results: We measured LTL by quantitative PCR in 566 outpatients (age 63±9 years, 76% male) with coronary artery disease (CAD). Circulating PCs were enumerated by flow cytometry. After adjustment for age, gender, race, BMI, smoking and previous myocardial infarction, a shorter LTL was associated with a lower CD34+ cell count: for each 10% shorter LTL, CD34+ levels were 5.2% lower (p<0.001). After adjustment for the aforementioned factors, both short LTL (<Q1) and low CD34+ levels (<Q1) predicted adverse cardiovascular outcomes (death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization or cerebrovascular events) independently of each other, with a hazards ratio (HR) of 1.8, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-2.0, and a HR of 2.1, 95% CI, 1.3-3.0, respectively, comparing Q1 to Q2-4. Patients who had both short LTL (<Q1) and low CD34+ cell count (<Q1), had the greatest risk of adverse outcomes (HR=3.5, 95% CI, 1.7-7.1). Conclusion: Although shorter LTL is associated with decreased regenerative capacity, both LTL and circulating PC levels are independent and additive predictors of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in CAD patients. Our results suggest that both biological aging and reduced regenerative capacity contribute to cardiovascular events, independent of conventional risk factors.},

Left stellate ganglionectomy or right stellate stimulation produces increased T-wave negativity without measurable change in the Q-T interval. The differing patterns of electrocardiographic wave form resulting from changes in sympathetic tone mediated by right and left stellate innervation could be correlated with changes in ventricular refractory period. Following right stellate ganglionectomy, refractory period prolongations were most marked over the anterior ventricular surface; left stellate ganglionectomy produced the greatest prolongation on the posterior surface. Although the right and left stellate innervations of the ventricles overlap, the left stellate influence is predominant over the posterior wall of the ventricles, while right stellate influence dominates the anterior ventricular walls. The electrocardiographic form changes observed following unilateral alteration of sympathetic tone paralleled those electrocardiographic abnormalities seen in patients with lesions of the central nervous system, suggesting a possible functional explanation for these clinical findings.},

abstract = {It is hypothesized that the heart possesses a nervous system intrinsic to it that represents the final relay station for the co-ordination of regional cardiac indices. This 'little brain' on the heart is comprised of spatially distributed sensory (afferent), interconnecting (local circuit) and motor (adrenergic and cholinergic efferent) neurones that communicate with others in intrathoracic extracardiac ganglia, all under the tonic influence of central neuronal command and circulating catecholamines. Neurones residing from the level of the heart to the insular cortex form temporally dependent reflexes that control overlapping, spatially determined cardiac indices. The emergent properties that most of its components display depend primarily on sensory transduction of the cardiovascular milieu. It is further hypothesized that the stochastic nature of such neuronal interactions represents a stabilizing feature that matches cardiac output to normal corporal blood flow demands. Thus, with regard to cardiac disease states, one must consider not only cardiac myocyte dysfunction but also the fact that components within this neuroaxis may interact abnormally to alter myocyte function. This review emphasizes the stochastic behaviour displayed by most peripheral cardiac neurones, which appears to be a consequence of their predominant cardiac chemosensory inputs, as well as their complex functional interconnectivity. Despite our limited understanding of the whole, current data indicate that the emergent properties displayed by most neurones comprising the cardiac neuroaxis will have to be taken into consideration when contemplating the targeting of its individual components if predictable, long-term therapeutic benefits are to accrue.},

abstract = {The risk of adverse cardiovascular events peaks in the morning (≈9:00 AM) with a secondary peak in the evening (≈8:00 PM) and a trough at night. This pattern is generally believed to be caused by the day/night distribution of behavioral triggers, but it is unknown whether the endogenous circadian system contributes to these daily fluctuations. Thus, we tested the hypotheses that the circadian system modulates autonomic, hemodynamic, and hemostatic risk markers at rest, and that behavioral stressors have different effects when they occur at different internal circadian phases. Twelve healthy adults were each studied in a 240-h forced desynchrony protocol in dim light while standardized rest and exercise periods were uniformly distributed across the circadian cycle. At rest, there were large circadian variations in plasma cortisol (peak-to-trough ≈85% of mean, peaking at a circadian phase corresponding to ≈9:00 AM) and in circulating catecholamines (epinephrine, ≈70%; norepinephrine, ≈35%, peaking during the biological day). At ≈8:00 PM, there was a circadian peak in blood pressure and a trough in cardiac vagal modulation. Sympathetic variables were consistently lowest and vagal markers highest during the biological night. We detected no simple circadian effect on hemostasis, although platelet aggregability had two peaks: at ≈noon and ≈11:00 PM. There was circadian modulation of the cardiovascular reactivity to exercise, with greatest vagal withdrawal at ≈9:00 AM and peaks in catecholamine reactivity at ≈9:00 AM and ≈9:00 PM. Thus, the circadian system modulates numerous cardiovascular risk markers at rest as well as their reactivity to exercise, with resultant profiles that could potentially contribute to the day/night pattern of adverse cardiovascular events.},

abstract = {Abnormal cardiovascular stress responses have been reported in Gulf War veterans with chronic fatigue. However, many of these veterans also suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which could potentially explain the reported abnormalities. To test this hypothesis, 55 Gulf veterans (GVs) with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) or idiopathic chronic fatigue (ICF) were stratified into groups with (N=16) and without (N=39) comorbid PTSD, and were compared to healthy Gulf veterans (N=47) on cardiovascular responses to a series of stressors. The CFS/ICF with PTSD group had lower blood pressure responses to speech and arithmetic tasks, and more precipitous declines and slower recoveries in blood pressure after standing up than the controls. Similar trends in the CF/ICF group without PTSD were not significant, however. Both CFS/ICF groups had blunted increases in peripheral vascular resistance during mental tasks. However, only the veterans with comorbid PTSD had diminished cardiac output responses to the mental stressors and excessive vasodilatory responses to standing. Symptoms of posttraumatic stress were significant predictors of hypotensive postural responses, but only in veterans reporting a significant exposure to wartime stress. We conclude that comorbid PTSD contributes to dysregulation of cardiovascular responses to mental and postural stressors in Gulf veterans with medically unexplained fatiguing illness, and may provide a physiological basis for increased somatic complaints in Gulf veterans with symptoms of posttraumatic stress. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

We aimed to study the cardiac rehabilitation (CR) modulating effect on autonomic function, through heart rate variability (HRV) and heart rate recovery (HRR) after exercise, in CAD patients and the associated factors. Methods This study is a retrospective analysis of CAD patients in sinus rhy thm who complete a single-centre CR programme and complementary evaluation including HRV study, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, echocardiogram. Results Our sample included 142 CAD patients (85.9% male, 57.8 ± 10.2 years, 85% post-acute coronary syndrome, 15% stable CAD). There was a significant improvement in SDNN (120.7 ± 40.7 ms vs 127.6 ± 41.5 ms; P = 0.019), resting HR (71.3 ± 10.7 min -1 vs 69.0 ± 10.9 min -1 ; P = 0.015) and HRR (23.8 ± 12.3 min -1 vs 27.1 ± 12.5 min -1 ; P = 0.017) following CR. Lower erythrocyte sedimentation rate (OR 0.911; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.838-0.989, P = 0.027), normal left ventricular (LV) function/mild LV systolic dysfunction (OR 7.879; 95% CI 2.753-17.351, P = 0.009) and SDNN lower than 100 ms (OR 9.325; 95% CI 1.775-48.978, P = 0.008) were independently associated with SDNN improvement; quit smoking (OR 4.323; 95% CI 1.136-16.454, P = 0.014) and abnormal HRR (OR 8.023; 95% CI 1.049-64.811, P = 0.035) were independently associated with HRR improvement. Conclusion The cardiac rehabilitation programme induced a positive modulation of the autonomic function in CAD patients, as reflected by SDNN and HRR improvement. This benefit was associated with ANS baseline dysfunction, lower systemic inflammation, quit smoking and normal LV function to mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction.},

HRV is a measure of cardiac autonomic functioning. METHOD: A cross-sectional comparison of 136 elderly persons with MDD and 136 non-depressed controls (matched for age and gender) recruited in family practices in the Netherlands. Depression was determined according to the DSM-IV criteria using the PRIME-MD. HRV was measured with an electrocardiogram (ECG) during a 5-minute supine rest. RESULTS: Multivariate analyses showed statistically significant decrease in HRV in MDD patients compared with controls. CONCLUSION: Older primary care patients with MDD have a reduced HRV. This may explain why depression is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality.},

abstract = {Myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with remodeling of the heart and neurohumoral control systems. The objective of this study was to define time-dependent changes in intrinsic cardiac (IC) neuronal excitability, synaptic efficacy, and neurochemical modulation following MI. MI was produced in guinea pigs by ligation of the coronary artery and associated vein on the dorsal surface of the heart. Animals were recovered for 4, 7, 14, or 50. days. Intracellular voltage recordings were obtained in whole mounts of the cardiac neuronal plexus to determine passive and active neuronal properties of IC neurons. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated an immediate and persistent increase in the percentage of IC neurons immunoreactive for neuronal nitric oxide synthase. Examination of individual neuronal properties demonstrated that afterhyperpolarizing potentials were significantly decreased in both amplitude and time course of recovery at 7. days post-MI. These parameters returned to control values by 50. days post-MI. Synaptic efficacy, as determined by the stimulation of axonal inputs, was enhanced at 7. days post-MI only. Neuronal excitability in absence of agonist challenge was unchanged following MI. Norepinephrine increased IC excitability to intracellular current injections, a response that was augmented post-MI. Angiotensin II potentiation of norepinephrine and bethanechol-induced excitability, evident in controls, was abolished post-MI. This study demonstrates that MI induces both persistent and transient changes in IC neuronal functions immediately following injury. Alterations in the IC neuronal network, which persist for weeks after the initial insult, may lead to alterations in autonomic signaling and cardiac control. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE While considerable attention has focused on improving the detection of depression, assessment of severity is also important in guiding treatment decisions. Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity. MEASUREMENTS The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as "0" (not at all) to "3" (nearly every day). The PHQ-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients. RESULTS As PHQ-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score > or =10 had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 88% for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples. CONCLUSION In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the PHQ-9 a useful clinical and research tool.},

abstract = {Objective: To (1) report the prognostic association between anxiety disorder subtypes and major adverse cardiac events (MACE), (2) report anxiety disorder prevalence in coronary heart disease (CHD), and (3) report the efficacy of anxiety disorder treatments in CHD. Methods: A comprehensive electronic database search was performed in November 2013 for studies reporting anxiety disorder prevalence according to structured interview in CHD samples or MACE, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing anxiety disorder treatment with placebo or usual care. From 4041 articles 42 samples were selected for extraction (8 for MACE prognosis, 39 for prevalence, no RCTs were eligible). Results: Five generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) studies reported 883 MACE events (combined n = 2851). There was a non-significant association between GAD and MACE (risk ratio = 1.20, 95% CI .86-1.68, P= .28) however the effect size was highly significant in outpatient samples (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.94, 95% CI 1.45-2.60, P< .001). No other anxiety disorder subtype was associated with MACE. Prevalence data showed high comorbidity with depression (49.06%; 95% CI 34.28-64.01) and substantial heterogeneity between studies. Panic disorder prevalence was higher in psychiatrist/psychologist raters (9.92% vs. 4.74%) as was GAD (18.45% vs. 13.01%). Panic and GAD estimates were also heterogeneous according to DSM-III-R versus DSM-IV taxonomies. Conclusions: The paucity of extant anxiety disorder RCTs, alongside MACE risk for GAD outpatients, should stimulate further anxiety disorder intervention in CHD populations. Research should focus on depression and anxiety, thereby unraveling disorder specific and more generic pathways.},

abstract = {Despite the revolutionary advancements in the past 3 decades in the treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmias with device-based therapy, sudden cardiac death (SCD) remains an enormous public health burden. Survivors of SCD are generally at high risk for recurrent events. The clinical management of such patients requires a multidisciplinary approach from postresuscitative care to a thorough cardiovascular investigation in an attempt to identify the underlying substrate, with potential to eliminate or modify the triggers through catheter ablation and ultimately an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for prompt treatment of recurrences in those at risk. Early recognition of low left ventricular ejection fraction as a strong predictor of death and association of ventricular arrhythmias with sudden death led to significant investigation with antiarrhythmic drugs. The lack of efficacy and the proarrhythmic effects of drugs catalyzed the development and investigation of the ICD through several major clinical trials that proved the efficacy of ICD as a bedrock tool to detect and promptly treat life-threatening arrhythmias. The ICD therapy is routinely used for primary prevention of SCD in patients with cardiomyopathy and high risk inherited arrhythmic conditions and secondary prevention in survivors of sudden cardiac arrest. This compendium will review the clinical management of those surviving SCD and discuss landmark studies of antiarrhythmic drugs, ICD, and cardiac resynchronization therapy in the primary and secondary prevention of SCD.},

Cardiovascular (CV) risk factors such as obesity, hypertension and dyslipidemia are common in patients with DM, placing them at increased risk for cardiac events. In addition, many studies have found biological mechanisms associated with DM that independently increase the risk of CVD in diabetic patients. Therefore, targeting CV risk factors in patients with DM is critical to minimize the long-term CV complications of the disease.

abstract = {We investigated the effects of laughing and weeping induced by watching comedy and tragedy videos on mood and autonomic nervous function. Ten healthy female subjects volunteered for the experiment. Chest electrocardiogram and respiration curve were recorded before, after, and during watching a comedy or a tragedy video. We also asked them to fill out profiles of mood states (POMS) to evaluate their mood states while watching videos. Autonomic nervous function was estimated by spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV). All subjects more or less laughed and wept while watching comedy and tragedy videos, respectively. Anger-hostility score of the POMS decreased and vigor score increased significantly after watching comedy videos, while depression-dejection score increased significantly after watching tragedy ones. Although both contents tended to increase a low to high frequency component ratio (LF/HF ratio) of HRV, the time course of responses was different. The LF/HF ratio which reflects cardiac sympathovagal balance increased immediately after they started watching comedy videos, and returned to the basal level right after they stopped watching, whereas the LF/HF ratio increased gradually to a lesser extent while watching tragedy videos. In contrast, the high-frequency component which reflects cardiac parasympathetic nerve activity gradually decreased while watching both videos but did not return to the basal level after watching tragedy ones. These results suggest that laughing has strong but transient effects on the autonomic nervous system, while weeping or feeling sad has moderate but sustained effects on it.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND We studied 715 patients 2 weeks after myocardial infarction to establish the associations between six frequency domain measures of heart period variability (HPV) and mortality during 4 years of follow-up. METHODS AND RESULTS Each measure of HPV had a significant and at least moderately strong univariate association with all-cause mortality, cardiac death, and arrhythmic death. Power in the lower-frequency bands--ultra low frequency (ULF) and very low frequency (VLF) power--had stronger associations with all three mortality end points than power in the higher-frequency bands--low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) power. The 24-hour total power also had a significant and strong association with all three mortality end points. VLF power was the only variable that was more strongly associated with arrhythmic death than with cardiac death or all-cause mortality. In multivariate Cox regression models using a step-up approach to evaluate the independent associations between frequency domain measures of heart period variability and death of all causes, ULF power was selected first (i.e., was the single component with the strongest association). Adding VLF or LF power to the Cox regression model significantly improved the prediction of outcome. With both ULF and VLF power in the Cox regression model, the addition of the other two components, LF and HF power, singly or together, did not significantly improve the prediction of all-cause mortality. We explored the relation between the heart period variability measures and all-cause mortality, cardiac death, and arrhythmic death before and after adjusting for five previously established postinfarction risk predictors: age, New York Heart Association functional class, rales in the coronary care unit, left ventricular ejection fraction, and ventricular arrhythmias detected in a 24-hour Holter ECG recording. CONCLUSIONS After adjustment for the five risk predictors, the association between mortality and total, ULF, and VLF power remained significant and strong, whereas LF and HF power were only moderately strongly associated with mortality. The tendency for VLF power to be more strongly associated with arrhythmic death than with all-cause or cardiac death was still evident after adjusting for the five covariates. Adding measures of HPV to previously known predictors of risk after myocardial infarction identifies small subgroups with a 2.5-year mortality risk of approximately 50%.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Coronary microvascular dysfunction may contribute to myocardial ischemia during mental stress (MS). However, the role of coronary epicardial and microvascular function in regulating coronary blood flow (CBF) responses during MS remains understudied. We hypothesized that coronary vasomotion during MS is dependent on the coronary microvascular endothelial function and will be reflected in the peripheral microvascular circulation. METHODS AND RESULTS In 38 patients aged 59±8 years undergoing coronary angiography, endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent coronary epicardial and microvascular responses were measured using intracoronary acetylcholine and nitroprusside, respectively, and after MS induced by mental arithmetic testing. Peripheral microvascular tone during MS was measured using peripheral arterial tonometry (Itamar Inc, Caesarea, Israel) as the ratio of digital pulse wave amplitude compared to rest (peripheral arterial tonometry ratio). MS increased the rate-pressure product by 22% (±23%) and constricted epicardial coronary arteries by -5.9% (-10.5%, -2.6%) (median [interquartile range]), P=0.001, without changing CBF. Acetylcholine increased CBF by 38.5% (8.1%, 91.3%), P=0.001, without epicardial coronary diameter change (0.1% [-10.9%, 8.2%], P=not significant). The MS-induced CBF response correlated with endothelium-dependent CBF changes with acetylcholine (r=0.38, P=0.03) but not with the response to nitroprusside. The peripheral arterial tonometry ratio also correlated with the demand-adjusted change in CBF during MS (r=-0.60, P=0.004), indicating similarity between the microcirculatory responses to MS in the coronary and peripheral microcirculation. CONCLUSIONS The coronary microvascular response to MS is determined by endothelium-dependent, but not endothelium-independent, coronary microvascular function. Moreover, the coronary microvascular responses to MS are reflected in the peripheral microvascular circulation.},

abstract = {Stimulation of the left ansa subclavia before and after occlusion of the anterior descending artery of the dog's heart has produced significantly greater ventricular arrhythmia responses in the post-occlusion trials than in trials before occlusion. Data are presented from two series of acute experiments, Series 1 an[@Harrisd Series 2 which include findings from 11 and 16 dogs, respectively. The experiments of the two series differed in types of electrical stimuli used and in elapsed time between occlusion of the artery and the first post-occlusion stimulation. All stimulations were applied when sinus rhythm was complete and no premature beats had occurred within a specified preceding duration. The arrhythmia responses in Series 1 were more intense (except that ventricular fibrillations were equal) and more prolonged than in Series 2. Reasons are discussed but not yet clear. The increased ventricular arrhythmia response persists strongly 5 days after occlusion. Propranolol, 0.5 mg/kg, blocked the arrhythmia response to sympathetic nerve stimulation completely during a period of 45-60 min after injection, but no blockade was apparent after 80 min. Possible mechanisms of origin of the induced arrhythmias were considered and evidence presented to indicate that individually generated discharges in ectopic pacemakers produced the arrhythmia in parts of the records and that reentry was the mechanism in other parts, particularly during approach to onset of ventricular fibrillation. The demonstration that brief periods of stimulation of sympathetic nerve strands to dog's hearts after coronary occlusion can produce ventricular arrhythmias of all degrees of severity including ventricular fibrillation suggests that emotional excitation of a myocardial infarction patient may induce similar ventricular arrhythmias and thereby place life in jeopardy. {\textcopyright} 1971.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although sudden cardiac death (SCD) is relatively common, contemporary data on its incidence are lacking. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the current incidence of SCD and its trend over the past 2 decades in a general middle-aged and elderly population. METHODS: This study was performed within the Rotterdam Study, a prospective population-based cohort study of persons aged 45 years and older. Age-standardized incidence rates of SCD were calculated. To study trends in incidence, we compared 2 subcohorts within the total study population, 1 followed from 1990-2000 and the other from 2001-2010. RESULTS: From 1990-2010, 5512 of 14,628 participants died, of whom 583 (4.0%) were classified as SCD. The overall incidence was 4.2 per 1000 person-years. The incidence was higher in men (5.2 per 1000 person-years) than in women (3.6 per 1000 person-years). Age-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.84 (95% confidence [CI] 1.56-2.17) and risk of SCD increased with age (HR 1.10 per year; 95% CI 1.09 -1.11). The incidence rate from 1990-2000 was 4.7 per 1000 person-years vs 2.1 per 1000 person-years from 2001-2010 (age- and sex-adjusted HR of SCD 0.60, 95% CI 0.44-0.80). To check for cohort effects, we also analyzed the incidence of total mortality and found an age- and sex-adjusted HR of total mortality of 0.82 (95% CI 0.75-0.90) for the second compared to the first subcohort, which was significantly higher than the decline in SCD incidence. CONCLUSION: We found an incidence of SCD of 4.2 per 1000 person-years. The incidence decreased from 1990-2010, a period during which the diagnosis and treatment of heart disease greatly improved.},

abstract = {In developed countries, the majority of all violent crime is committed by a small group of antisocial recidivistic offenders, but no genes have been shown to contribute to recidivistic violent offending or severe violent behavior, such as homicide. Our results, from two independent cohorts of Finnish prisoners, revealed that a monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) low-activity genotype (contributing to low dopamine turnover rate) as well as the CDH13 gene (coding for neuronal membrane adhesion protein) are associated with extremely violent behavior (at least 10 committed homicides, attempted homicides or batteries). No substantial signal was observed for either MAOA or CDH13 among non-violent offenders, indicating that findings were specific for violent offending, and not largely attributable to substance abuse or antisocial personality disorder. These results indicate both low monoamine metabolism and neuronal membrane dysfunction as plausible factors in the etiology of extreme criminal violent behavior, and imply that at least about 5-10% of all severe violent crime in Finland is attributable to the aforementioned MAOA and CDH13 genotypes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Depression is known to be associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD). This population-based cohort study aimed to determine the association between depression of varying severity and risk for CVD and to study the effect of concomitant anxious distress on this association. METHODS We utilized data from a longitudinal cohort study of mental health, work and relations among adults (20-64 years), with a total of 10,443 individuals. Depression and anxious distress were assessed using psychiatric rating scales and defined according to DSM-5. Outcomes were register-based and self-reported cardiovascular diseases. FINDINGS Overall increased odds ratios of 1.5 to 2.6 were seen for the different severity levels of depression, with the highest adjusted OR for moderate depression (OR 2.1 (95% CI 1.3, 3.5). Similar odds ratios were seen for sub-groups of CVD: ischemic/hypertensive heart disease and stroke, 2.4 (95% CI 1.4, 3.9) and OR 2.1 (95%CI 1.2, 3.8) respectively. Depression with anxious distress as a specifier of severity showed OR of 2.1 (95% CI 1.5, 2.9) for CVD. CONCLUSION This study found that severity level of depression seems to be of significance for increased risk of CVD among depressed persons, although not in a dose-response manner which might be obscured due to treatment of depression. Further, we found a higher risk of CVD among depressed individuals with symptoms of anxious distress.},

abstract = {Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) risk. We tested the hypothesis that PTSD patients have augmented sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and hemodynamic reactivity during mental stress, and impaired arterial baroreflex sensitivity (BRS). 14 otherwise healthy Veterans with combat-related PTSD were compared to 14 matched Controls without PTSD. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), continuous blood pressure (BP), and electrocardiography were measured at baseline, and during two types of mental stress: combat-related mental stress using virtual reality combat exposure (VRCE); and noncombat related stress using mental arithmetic (MA). Cold pressor test (CPT) was administered for comparison. BRS was tested using pharmacologic manipulation of BP via the Modified Oxford technique at rest and during VRCE. Blood samples were analysed for inflammatory biomarkers. Baseline characteristics, MSNA and hemodynamics were similar between the groups. In PTSD versus Controls, MSNA (+8.2 ± 1.0 vs +1.2 ± 1.3 bursts/min P < 0.001) and heart rate (HR) responses (+3.2 ± 1.1 vs −2.3 ± 1.0 beats/min, P = 0.003) were significantly augmented during VRCE. Similarly, in PTSD versus Controls, MSNA (+21.0 ± 2.6 vs +6.7 ± 1.5 bursts/min, P < 0.001) and diastolic BP responses (+6.3 ± 1.0 vs +3.5 ± 1.0 mmHg, P = 0.011) were significantly augmented during MA, but not during CPT (P = NS). In the PTSD group, sympathetic BRS (-1.2 ± 0.2 vs -2.0 ± 0.3 BI mmHg−1, P = 0.026) and cardiovagal BRS (9.5 ± 1.4 vs 23.6 ± 4.3 ms mmHg−1, P = 0.008) were significantly blunted at rest. PTSD patients had significantly higher hs-CRP levels compared to Controls (2.1 ± 0.4 vs 1.0 ± 0.3 mg L−1, P = 0.047). Augmented SNS and hemodynamic responses to mental stress, blunted BRS, and inflammation may contribute to increased CV risk in PTSD.},

The main goal of this study is to test the association between SNPs in CDH13 and CTNNA2 genes and ADHD across the life cycle in subjects with ADHD. This study included 1,136 unrelated ADHD cases and 946 individuals without ADHD. No significant association between CDH13 and CTNNA2 was observed between cases and controls across different samples (P ≥ 0.096 for all comparisons). No allele was significantly more transmitted than expected from parents to ADHD probands. The CDH13 rs11150556 CC genotype was associated with more hyperactive/impulsive symptoms in youths with ADHD (children/adolescents clinical sample: F = 7.666, P = 0.006, FDR P-value = 0.032; Pelotas Birth Cohort sample: F = 6.711, P = 0.011, FDR P-value = 0.032). Although there are many open questions regarding the role of neurodevelopmental genes in ADHD symptoms, the present study suggests that CDH13 is associated with hyperactive/impulsive symptoms in youths with ADHD.},

abstract = {Background: A major objective of precision medicine is the elucidation of non-invasive biomarkers of cardiovascular (CV) risk. Recently, we introduced a new dynamical marker of sino-atrial instability, termed heart rate fragmentation (HRF), which outperformed traditional and nonlinear heart rate variability metrics in separating ostensibly healthy subjects from patients with coronary artery disease. Accordingly, we hypothesized that HRF may be a dynamical biomarker of adverse cardiovascular events (CVEs). Methods: This study employed data from a cohort of participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a prospective study of sub-clinical heart disease. Interbeat interval time series (n = 1963), derived from the electrocardiographic channel of the polysomnogram study, were analyzed using the newly introduced metrics of fragmentation, as well as traditional heart rate variability (HRV) indices and the short-term detrended fluctuation analysis exponent. Cox regression analysis was used to assess the association between HR dynamic indices and CV outcomes in unadjusted and adjusted models. Results: The mean (± SD) follow-up time was 2.97 ± 0.63 years. In adjusted models, higher fragmentation was significantly associated with incident CVEs (number of events; hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: n = 72, 1.43 [1.16-1.76]) and CV death (n = 21; 1.65 [1.15-2.36]). The traditional HRV and the fractal indices were not associated with CVEs or CV death. The most discriminatory fragmentation indices added significant value to Framingham and MESA CV risk indices in all analyses. Costa et al. Heart Rate Fragmentation and Cardiac Risk Conclusion: Our findings show that HRF has promise as a non-invasive, automatable biomarker of CV risk. The basic mechanisms underlying fragmentation remain to be delineated. Its association with incident outcomes raises the possibility of connections to degenerative changes in the multisystem network controlling SAN function.},

abstract = {During the classic "fight-or-flight" stress response, sympathetic nervous system activation leads to catecholamine release, which increases heart rate and contractility, resulting in enhanced cardiac output. Catecholamines bind to $\beta$-adrenergic receptors, causing cAMP generation and activation of PKA, which phosphorylates multiple targets in cardiac muscle, including the cardiac ryanodine receptor/calcium release channel (RyR2) required for muscle contraction. PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 enhances channel activity by sensitizing the channel to cytosolic calcium (Ca²+). Here, we found that mice harboring RyR2 channels that cannot be PKA phosphorylated (referred to herein as RyR2-S2808A+/+ mice) exhibited blunted heart rate and cardiac contractile responses to catecholamines (isoproterenol). The isoproterenol-induced enhancement of ventricular myocyte Ca²+ transients and fractional shortening (contraction) and the spontaneous beating rate of sinoatrial nodal cells were all blunted in RyR2-S2808A+/+ mice. The blunted cardiac response to catecholamines in RyR2-S2808A+/+ mice resulted in impaired exercise capacity. RyR2-S2808A+/+ mice were protected against chronic catecholaminergic-induced cardiac dysfunction. These studies identify what we believe to be new roles for PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 in both the heart rate and contractile responses to acute catecholaminergic stimulation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Vital exhaustion (VE), a construct defined as lack of energy, increased fatigue and irritability, and feelings of demoralisation, has been associated with cardiovascular events. We sought to examine the relation between VE and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. METHODS The ARIC Study is a predominately biracial cohort of men and women, aged 45-64 at baseline, initiated in 1987 through random sampling in four US communities. VE was measured using the Maastricht questionnaire between 1990 and 1992 among 13 923 individuals. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the hazard of out-of-hospital SCD across tertiles of VE scores. RESULTS Through 2012, 457 SCD cases, defined as a sudden pulseless condition presumed due to a ventricular tachyarrhythmia in a previously stable individual, were identified in ARIC by physician record review. Adjusting for age, sex and race/centre, participants in the highest VE tertile had an increased risk of SCD (HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.87), but these findings did not remain significant after adjustment for established cardiovascular disease risk factors (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.20). CONCLUSIONS Among participants of the ARIC study, VE was not associated with an increased risk for SCD after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors.},

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is highly prevalent and independently associated with atrial fibrillation among patients with HCM. Objective To determine the relationship between non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and OSA in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Methods One hundred thirty consecutive patients with a confirmed diagnosis of HOCM in Fuwai Hospital between September 2017 and May 2018 were included. Polysomnography and Holter electrocardiography were performed in all patients. Results Of 130 patients, 72 (55.4%) were diagnosed with OSA, including 38 with mild, 21 with moderate, and 13 with severe OSA, and 27 (20.8%) patients had NSVT. The prevalence of NSVT increased with the severity of OSA (none, mild, moderate, and severe: 12.1%, 15.8%, 33.3%, and 53.8%, respectively; p for trend Conclusion The presence and severity of OSA in patients with HOCM is independently associated with NSVT, which is a risk factor for SCD and cardiovascular death in this population.},

abstract = {Background: Somatic depressive symptoms and certain biomarkers are each associated with worse acute myocardial infarction (AMI) prognosis, but the relationship between depressive symptom domains and inflammatory, neurohormonal, and coagulation markers is unknown. Methods: We examined the relationship between depressive symptoms and 1-month biomarker levels (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP], N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP], white blood cell [WBC], platelet counts) in 1265 AMI patients. Depressive symptoms (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire) were assessed during index hospitalization and categorized as somatic or cognitive. Using median regression models, the upper quartile of somatic and cognitive depression scores and each biomarker were compared with the lower three quartiles, adjusting for site, demographics, and clinical characteristics. Results: Although hs-CRP values were higher in patients with somatic symptoms, this association was attenuated after adjustment (B per SD increase =.02, 95% confidence interval:.00;.05, p =.07). WBC count was independently associated with somatic depressive symptoms (B per SD increase =.28, 95% confidence interval:.12;.44, p <.001). Cognitive depressive symptoms were not associated with hs-CRP or WBC count. Neither dimension was associated with NT-proBNP or platelet levels. For each biomarker, the depression dimensions explained <1% of their variation. Conclusions: Neither somatic nor cognitive depressive symptoms were meaningfully associated with hs-CRP, NT-proBNP, WBC, or platelet counts 1 month after AMI, suggesting that the association between depression and long-term outcomes may be unrelated to these biomarkers. Future research should explore other biomarkers to better illuminate pathways by which depression adversely impacts AMI prognosis. {\textcopyright} 2012 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract = {This study evaluated the effects of propranolol on recovery of heart rate variability (HRV) after acute myocardial infarction and its relation to outcome in the Beta-blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT). Beta blockers improve mortality after acute myocardial infarction, but through an unknown mechanism. Depressed HRV, a measure of autonomic tone, predicts mortality after acute myocardial infarction. Whether $\beta$ blockers influence recovery of HRV after acute myocardial infarction, and thereby improve outcome, is unknown. We compared 24-hour HRV parameters at 1 week after acute myocardial infarction and after 6 weeks of treatment with propanolol (n = 88) or placebo (n = 96). The relation between 25-month outcome (death/acute myocardial infarction/congestive heart failure), propranolol treatment, and HRV was further analyzed. After 6 weeks, high-frequency (HF) power (log-normalized), an index of vagal tone, increased more in propranolol-treated patients (4.28 ± 0.1 to 5.17 ± 0.09 ms2) than in placebo-treated patients (4.26 ± 0.09 to 4.77 ± 0.1 ms2, p <0.05). Sympathovagal balance measured by the low-frequency (LF) to HF ratio increased in placebo-treated patients (3.55 ± 0.24 to 3.86 ± 0.24) but decreased in those treated with propranolol (3.76 ± 0.29 to 3.17 ± 0.23, p <0.01). Other frequency-domain parameters increased over time but were not affected by propranolol. Propranolol blunted the morning increase in the LF/HF ratio. Recovery of HF, the strongest HRV predictor of outcome, and propranolol therapy independently predicted outcome. In summary, after acute myocardial infarction, propranolol therapy improves recovery of parasympathetic tone, which correlates with improved outcome, and decreases morning sympathetic predominance. These findings may elucidate the mechanisms by which $\beta$ blockers decrease mortality and reduce the early morning risk of sudden death after acute myocardial infarction. {\textcopyright} 2003 by Excerpta Medica, Inc.},

abstract = {Background: Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) is associated with increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, yet the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We measured the inflammatory response to acute laboratory mental stress in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and its association with MSIMI. We hypothesized that patients with MSIMI would have a higher inflammatory response to mental stress in comparison to those without ischemia. Methods: Patients with stable CAD underwent 99mTc sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging during mental stress testing using a public speaking stressor. MSIMI was determined as impaired myocardial perfusion using a 17-segment model. Inflammatory markers including interleukin-6 (IL-6), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) and high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP) were measured at rest and 90 min after mental stress. Results were validated in an independent sample of 228 post-myocardial infarction patients. Results: Of 607 patients analyzed in this study, (mean age 63 ± 9 years, 76% male), 99 (16.3%) developed MSIMI. Mental stress resulted in a significant increase in IL-6, MCP-1, and MMP-9 (all p <0.0001), but not hsCRP. However, the changes in these markers were similar in those with and without MSIMI. Neither resting levels of these biomarkers, nor their changes with mental stress were significantly associated with MSIMI. Results in the replication sample were similar. Conclusion: Mental stress is associated with acute increases in several inflammatory markers. However, neither the baseline inflammatory status nor the magnitude of the inflammatory response to mental stress over 90 min were significantly associated with MSIMI.},

abstract = {editor ANESTHESIOLOGY, V XXX • NO XXX XXX 2019 1 T horacic epidural anesthesia is widely applied in tho-racic and abdominal surgical procedures, because it provides excellent analgesia and decreases postoperative pulmonary complications. 1,2 Epidural anesthesia with local anesthetics produces sensory and motor blockade but also affects the autonomic nervous system. The resultant effects on the cardiovascular system vary with the level and the extent of sympathetic blockade. Involvement of the lower thoracic region (T6 to L1) by thoracic epidural anesthesia is associated with increased venous capacitance and redistribution of blood to the dilated splanchnic veins. This results in decreased venous return to the heart and a reduction of cardiac preload. 3 Arterial vasodilation in blocked segments is counteracted by compensatory vasoconstriction in unblocked segments, and the effect on cardiac afterload depends on the balance between blocked and unblocked segments. 4 Direct effects of cardiac sympatholysis have not been the subject of detailed investigation. Many studies quantified the cardiac effects of thoracic epidural anesthesia using load-dependent indices of contractile performance, which does not allow differentiation between direct and indirect effects. Regardless, the effects of thoracic epidural anesthesia have generally been considered beneficial to the cardiovascular system and protective against surgical stress. 5 Interestingly, recent systematic reviews have not been able to confirm improved cardiac outcome in surgical patients treated with thoracic epidural anesthesia. 6 In contrast, some evidence was found for increased cardiovascular problems in high-risk patients receiving neuraxial block. 7,8 In light of these concerns, a reappraisal of the cardiovascular effects associated with the use of thoracic epidural anesthesia seems appropriate. Since the last published review on this subject, 9 new data have emerged from experimental and clinical studies addressing previously unexplored domains such as the effects of cardiac sympathectomy on right ven-tricular function, an important determinant of outcome in surgery. 10-12 We conducted the present review to update the knowledge in this field, with focus on the effects associated with high-thoracic epidural anesthesia and cardiac sympa-thectomy in the normal and diseased cardiovascular system. Materials and Methods The databases PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane were searched by the author and by an independent expert librarian to identify studies in which the cardiac sympathetic nerves (T1 to T5) are involved in neural blockade by thoracic epidural anesthesia. An extensive list of used ABStRAct Cardiac sympathetic blockade with high-thoracic epidural anesthesia is considered beneficial in patients undergoing major surgery because it offers protection in ischemic heart disease. Major outcome studies have failed to confirm such a benefit, however. In fact, there is growing concern about potential harm associated with the use of thoracic epidural anesthesia in high-risk patients, although underlying mechanisms have not been identified. Since the latest review on this subject, a number of clinical and experimental studies have provided new information on the complex interaction between thoracic epidural anesthesia-induced sympatholysis and cardiovascular control mechanisms. Perhaps these new insights may help identify conditions in which benefits of thoracic epidural anesthesia may not outweigh potential risks. For example, cardiac sympathectomy with high-thoracic epidural anesthesia decreases right ventricular function and attenuates its capacity to cope with increased right ventricular afterload. Although the clinical significance of this pathophysiologic interaction is unknown at present, it identifies a subgroup of patients with established or pending pulmonary hypertension for whom outcome studies are needed. Other new areas of interest include the impact of thoracic epidural anesthesia-induced sympatholysis on cardiovascular control in conditions associated with increased sympathetic tone, surgical stress, and hemodynamic disruption. It was considered appropriate to collect and analyze all recent scientific information on this subject to provide a comprehensive update on the cardiovascular effects of high-thoracic epidural anesthesia and cardiac sympathectomy in healthy and diseased patients.},

abstract = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. The understanding of the risk factors for CVD may yield important insights into the prevention, etiology, course, and treatment of this major public health concern. Autonomic imbalance, characterized by a hyperactive sympathetic system and a hypoactive parasympathetic system, is associated with various pathological conditions. Over time, excessive energy demands on the system can lead to premature aging and diseases. Therefore, autonomic imbalance may be a final common pathway to increased morbidity and mortality from a host of conditions and diseases, including cardiovascular disease. Heart rate variability (HRV) may be used to assess autonomic imbalances, diseases and mortality. Parasympathetic activity and HRV have been associated with a wide range of conditions including CVD. Here we review the evidence linking HRV to established and emerging modifiable and non-modifiable CVD risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, family history and work stress. Substantial evidence exists to support the notion that decreased HRV precedes the development of a number of risk factors and that lowering risk profiles is associated with increased HRV. We close with a suggestion that a model of autonomic imbalance may provide a unifying framework within which to investigate the impact of risk factors, including psychosocial factors and work stress, on cardiovascular disease. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

At 2 weeks after AMI (n = 70), the low-frequency component was significantly greater (69 ± 2 vs 53 ± 3 normalized units [NU], p < 0.05) and the high-frequency component was significantly smaller (17 ± 1 vs 35 ± 3 NU) than in 26 age-matched control subjects.

At 6 (n = 33) and 12 (n = 29) months after AMI, a progressive decrease in the low- (62 ± 2 and 54 ± 3 NU) and an increase in the high-frequency (23 ± 2 and 30 ± 2 NU) spectral components was observed, which suggested a normalization of sympathovagal interaction. An increase in sympathetic efferent activity induced by tilt did not further modify the low-frequency spectral component (78 ± 3 vs 74 ± 3 NU) in a subgroup of 24 patients at 2 weeks after AMI. Instead, 1 year after AMI, this maneuver was accompanied by an increase in the low-frequency component (77 ± 3 vs 53 ± 3 NU, p < 0.05) of a magnitude similar to the one observed in control subjects (78 ± 3 vs 53 ± 3 NU). These data indicate that the sympathetic predominance that is detectable 2 weeks after AMI is followed by recovery of vagal tone and a normalization of sympathovagal interaction, not only during resting conditions, but also in response to a sympathetic stimulus. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

abstract = {Attenuated cardiac parasympathetic activity appear to be an important risk factor contributing to sudden cardiac death in subjects with overt coronary disease but its predictive value in otherwise healthy normal subjects is not known. We have for 8 years followed 260 apparently healthy adult subjects who underwent Holter monitoring. Twelve died, 14 developed ischaemic heart disease and four suffered sudden cardiac death. A healthy control subject was matched, along with other risk factors, for each case. In each subject 24-h heart rate variability was calculated as the deviation of all normal R-R intervals from mean R-R (SD) and the percentage of successive R-R interval differences exceeding 6% (%DIF6%)--this was used as an index of cardiac parasympathetic activity. There were no significant differences in heart rate variability between the cases developing problems and controls. In the sudden cardiac death victims, however, there was a clear trend towards lower heart rate variability. In them waketime mean SD was 73 ms versus 85 ms for cases and controls respectively (p = 0.08), and for sleeptime 61 ms versus 76 ms (p = 0.07). Compared to normal limits for heart rate variability obtained in 140 subjects that remained healthy for 8 years, figures for both SD and %DIF6% in sudden cardiac death subjects were at or below 95% confidence limits. The results indicate that altered autonomic balance may contribute to sudden cardiac death even in apparently healthy subjects. Subjects with a low 24-h heart rate variability on Holter monitoring may be predicted at an early stage of being at greater risk.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE Myocardial scarring leads to cardiac dysfunction and poor prognosis. The prevalence of and factors associated with unrecognized myocardial infarction and scar have not been previously defined using contemporary methods in a multiethnic US population. OBJECTIVE To determine prevalence of and factors associated with myocardial scar in middle- and older-aged individuals in the United States. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study is a population-based cohort in the United States. Participants were aged 45 through 84 years and free of clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) at baseline in 2000-2002. In the 10th year examination (2010-2012), 1840 participants underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging with gadolinium to detect myocardial scar. Cardiovascular disease risk factors and coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores were measured at baseline and year 10. Logistic regression models were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for myocardial scar. EXPOSURES Cardiovascular risk factors, CAC scores, left ventricle size and function, and carotid intima-media thickness. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Myocardial scar detected by CMR imaging. RESULTS Of 1840 participants (mean [SD] age, 68 [9] years, 52% men), 146 (7.9%) had myocardial scars, of which 114 (78%) were undetected by electrocardiogram or by clinical adjudication. In adjusted models, age, male sex, body mass index, hypertension, and current smoking at baseline were associated with myocardial scar at year 10. The OR per 8.9-year increment was 1.61 (95% CI, 1.36-1.91; P < .001); for men vs women: OR, 5.76 (95% CI, 3.61-9.17; P < .001); per 4.8-SD body mass index: OR, 1.32 (95% CI, 1.09-1.61, P = .005); for hypertension: OR, 1.61 (95% CI, 1.12-2.30; P = .009); and for current vs never smokers: 2.00 (95% CI, 1.22-3.28; P = .006). Age-, sex-, and ethnicity-adjusted CAC scores at baseline were also associated with myocardial scar at year 10. Compared with a CAC score of 0, the OR for scores from 1 through 99 was 2.4 (95% CI, 1.5-3.9); from 100 through 399, 3.0 (95% CI, 1.7-5.1), and 400 or higher, 3.3 (95% CI, 1.7-6.1) (P ≤ .001). The CAC score significantly added to the association of myocardial scar with age, sex, race/ethnicity, and traditional CVD risk factors (C statistic, 0.81 with CAC vs 0.79 without CAC, P = .01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The prevalence of myocardial scars in a US community-based multiethnic cohort was 7.9%, of which 78% were unrecognized by electrocardiography or clinical evaluation. Further studies are needed to understand the clinical consequences of these undetected scars.},

abstract = {AIMS Heart failure (HF) is associated with tissue hypoperfusion and congestion leading to organ dysfunction. Although cerebral blood flow (CBF) is preserved over a wide range of perfusion pressures in healthy subjects, it is impaired in end-stage HF. We aimed to compare CBF, autoregulation, and cognitive function in patients with mild non-ischaemic HF with healthy controls. METHODS AND RESULTS Fifteen patients with mild idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and 15 matched healthy controls were studied. Co-existing cerebrovascular disease was excluded. All subjects, except five patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, underwent magnetic resonance imaging for measurements of both CBF by arterial spin labelling and quantitative volume flow entering the brain. Cardiocerebral vascular function was assessed with Doppler techniques testing cerebral dynamic autoregulation and vasomotor reactivity. Cognitive analysis was performed by neuropsychological testing. Global and regional CBF did not differ between HF patients (44.3 mL/100 g.min) and controls (42.1 mL/100 g.min). Basilar but not carotid artery inflow was reduced in patients (1.95 mL/s vs. 2.51 mL/s, P = 0.009). Testing autoregulation revealed fewer dampened blood flow fluctuations in HF patients vs. controls (0.96% vs. 0.67%, P < 0.001). Vasomotor reactivity in HF patients showed a reduced CBF velocity (48.4% vs. 61.0%, P = 0.05) and regional cerebral oxygen saturation (18.3% vs. 23.8%, P = 0.02). Cognitive function overall was not affected. CONCLUSION Although global CBF was unaffected in patients with mild HF, significant changes in basilar inflow volume, cerebral autoregulation and vasomotor reactivity were observed. We describe a model of dynamic cerebral mechanisms required to compensate for the impaired haemodynamics in early-stage HF.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Clinical depression is associated with an increased risk for mortality in patients with a recent myocardial infarction (MI). Reduced heart rate variability (HRV) has been suggested as a possible explanation for this association. The purpose of this study was to determine if depression is associated with reduced HRV in patients with a recent MI. METHODS AND RESULTS Three hundred eighty acute MI patients with depression and 424 acute MI patients without depression were recruited. All underwent 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring after hospital discharge. In univariate analyses, 4 indices of HRV were significantly lower in patients with depression than in patients without depression. Variables associated with HRV were then compared between patients with and without depression, and potential confounds were identified. These variables (age, sex, diabetes, and present cigarette smoking) were entered into an analysis of covariance model, followed by depression status. In the final model, all but one HRV index (high-frequency power) remained significantly lower in patients with depression than in patients without depression. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that greater autonomic dysfunction, as reflected by decreased HRV, is a plausible mechanism linking depression to increased cardiac mortality in post-MI patients.},

abstract = {Background: Various disciplines use quantification of heart rate variability (HRV) as an indicator of autonomic function without recognizing the importance of using standardized methodologies. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of tachogram length and period of recording on HRV indicator values. Methods: To test the influence of the length of the recording time, HRV indicator values calculated from 180, 300, 420, and 600 seconds recording periods (supine and standing) were compared. Also individual 3- minute periods (0-180 seconds, 180-360 seconds, 360-540 seconds) from 10-minute (supine and standing) tachograms were compared. Results: In the supine position, vagal-efferent HRV indicators were not influenced by tachogram length varying between 3 and 10 minutes (P > 0.05). Supine HRV indicator values representing combined sympathetic and parasympathetic influences were tachogram length-dependent (P < 0.05). During orthostatic stress all HRV indicators were tachogram length-dependent (P < 0.05). Upon standing up marked vagal withdrawal and sympathetic activation occurred. Vagal withdrawal tapered off during the 3-6-minute period after rising while indicators representing combined vagal and sympathetic activation were totally reversed. Conclusions: During application of orthostatic stress the exact starting point of recording, as well as the length of recording, is critical due to the activation and normalization of homeostatic mechanisms. Starting the tachogram recording too late will miss out on part of the initial response to change in body position. Longer recording times will give a combination of values recorded during the stress response and values obtained after stabilization in the standing position.

Both functions have been investigated for a long time; however, several challenges remain unsolved, such as the confusion between activities and the recognition of energy-consuming activities involving little or no movement. To solve these problems, we propose a novel approach using an accelerometer and electrocardiogram (ECG). First, we collected a database of six activities (sitting, standing, walking, ascending, resting and running) of 13 voluntary participants. We compared the HAR performances of three models with respect to the input data type (with none, all, or some of the heart-rate variability (HRV) parameters). The best recognition performance was 96.35%, which was obtained with some selected HRV parameters. EE was also estimated for different choices of the input data type (with or without HRV parameters) and the model type (single and activity-specific). The best estimation performance was found in the case of the activity-specific model with HRV parameters. Our findings indicate that the use of human physiological data, obtained by wearable sensors, has a significant impact on both HAR and EE estimation, which are crucial functions in the mobile healthcare system.},

abstract = {The heart receives both a left and right sympathetic innervation. Currently there is no description of an in vitro whole heart preparation for comparing the influence of each sympathetic supply on cardiac function. The aim was to establish the viability of using an in vitro model to investigate the effects of left and right sympathetic chain stimulation (LSS/RSS). For this purpose the upper sympathetic chain on each side was isolated and bipolar stimulating electrodes were attached between T2-T3 and electrically insulated from surrounding tissue in a Langendorff innervated rabbit heart preparation (n = 8). Heart rate (HR) was investigated during sinus rhythm, whilst dromotropic, inotropic and ventricular electrophysiological effects were measured during constant pacing (250. bpm). All responses exhibited linear increases with increases in stimulation frequency (2-10. Hz). The change in HR was larger during RSS than LSS (P. <. 0.01), increasing by 78. ±. 9. bpm and 49. ±. 8. bpm respectively (10. Hz, baseline; 145. ±. 7. bpm). Left ventricular pressure was increased from a baseline of 50. ±. 4. mm. Hg, by 22. ±. 5. mm. Hg (LSS, 10. Hz) and 4. ±. 1. mm. Hg (RSS, 10. Hz) respectively (P. <. 0.001). LSS, but not RSS, caused a shortening of basal and apical monophasic action potential duration (MAPD90). We demonstrate that RSS exerts a greater effect at the sinoatrial node and LSS at the left ventricle. The study confirms previous experiments on dogs and cats, provides quantitative data on the comparative influence of right and left sympathetic nerves and demonstrates the feasibility of isolating and stimulating the ipsilateral cardiac sympathetic supply in an in vitro innervated rabbit heart preparation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The frequency of adverse cardiovascular events is greater in the morning compared to its 24-hour average. A circadian variation in the regulation of the cardiovascular system could contribute to this increased cardiovascular risk in the morning. Indeed, circadian rhythms have been shown for a wide array of physiological processes. Using an ultradian sleep-wake cycle (USW) procedure, we sought to determine how heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) correlate with the well-characterized circadian rhythms of cortisol and melatonin secretion. Specific HRV components, namely the low frequency (LF) power, high frequency (HF) power, and the LF:HF ratio can be used as markers of the autonomic modulation of the heart. Cross-correlation between HRV parameters and hormonal rhythms demonstrated that mean RR interval is significantly phase-advanced relative to salivary cortisol and urinary 6-sulfatoxy-melatonin (UaMt6s). Parasympathetic modulation of the heart (HF power) was phase-advanced relative to cortisol, but was in-phase with UaMt6s levels. Maximal correlation of the sympathovagal balance (the LF:HF ratio) had no significant lag compared to cortisol secretion and UaMt6s excretion. The protective effect of the parasympathetic nervous system at night, combined with the putative risk associated with the sympathetic nervous system peaking in the morning, could be associated with the increased cardiovascular risk observed in the morning hours.},

abstract = {The effect of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) upon ventricular vulnerability was studied in 30 mongrel dogs subjected to varying levels of adrenergic stimulation. Vulnerability was assessed both by determining the minimum current required to produce ventricular fibrillation (VF threshold) and by plotting VF threshold throughout the vulnerable period (VF zone). Chloralose-anesthetized animals were studied by means of sequential pulses applied to the apex of the right ventricular endocardium. Testing was carried out in closed-chest dogs, in open-chest dogs with and without left stellate ganglion stimulation (LSGS), and in open-and closed-chest dogs pretreated with propranolol. In the absence of adrenergic stimulation, VNS was without significant effect on either the VF threshold or the VF zone under closed-or open-chest conditions. During LSGS, however, VNS was associated with a 93 ± 22% (mean SE) increase in VF threshold (P < 0.01) and constriction of the VF zone. Vagus nerve stimulation combined with LSGS raised VF threshold to the control value, but not beyond. After beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol, VNS was without effect on VF threshold in either open-or closed-chest animals. It is concluded that augmented sympathetic tone is a precondition for a VNS-induced elevation in VF threshold. The vagal effect is indirect and is expressed by opposing the effects of heightened adrenergic tone on ventricular vulnerability. IN THEIR CLASSIC STUDIES on cardiac ex-citability, Hoffman, Brooks, and co-workers1-4 found that vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) was without significant effect on the electrical properties of the ventricle. Evidence to the contrary has recently been provided by Kent and Harrison et al.5' 6 When the ventricular fibrillation (VF) threshold was determined by means of a train of electrical pulses closely coupled to an antecedent paced beat, it was found that both VNS5 and edrophonium chloride" consistently raised VF threshold in the normal as well as the ischemic canine ventricle. The protection against fibrillation was independent of vagally-mediated bradycardia. Preliminary experiments by our group7 appeared to support the traditional view: we found that VNS had no effect on ventricular vulnerability in the non-ischemic heart. Furthermore, in animals subjected to beta-adrenergic blockade, hypothalamic stimulation,8 and reflex vagal activation by means of blood pressure elevation9 were without effect on VF threshold. In intact animals, parasympathetic discharge does not occur in isolation, but rather concomitantly with activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Vagal effects on such inotropic and chronotropic parameters as sinus rate of the intact heart'0 or contractile force of the isovolumic canine ventricle" are considerably influenced by the level of prevailing adrenergic tone. It may be that differing degrees of interaction between the two components of the autonomic nervous system account for the disparate findings as tothe role of vagal stimulation on ventricular vulnerability. To test whether this is indeed the case, the present studies were conducted under conditions which corresponded to varying levels of adrenergic input: in closed-chest dogs, in open-chest dogs, in open-chest dogs during continuous supramaximal left stellate ganglion stimulation (LSGS), and finally in both closed-and open-chest dogs subjected to acute beta-adrenergic blockade. In these experiments, both quantitative and qualitative appraisal of susceptibility to induce VF was made possible by determining the overall temporal configuration of vulnerability, as well as the VF threshold. Material and Methods Thirty healthy mongrel dogs, weighing 7-25 kg, were studied. The animals were anesthetized with i.v. administration of brevital (5 mg/kg), followed by 100 mg/kg alpha-chloralose. Additional booster doses of 50 mg/kg alpha-chloralose were given as required; a minimum of 30 min},

abstract = {This study was prompted by the prospect of transgenic pigs providing donor hearts for transplantation in human recipients. Autonomic innervation is important for the control of cardiac dynamics, especially in the conduction system. Our objective was to assess the relative distribution of autonomic nerves in the pig heart, focusing initially on the conduction system but addressing also the myocardium, endocardium and epicardium (see Crick et al. 1999). Quantitative immunohistochemical and histochemical techniques were adopted. All regions of the conduction system possessed a significantly higher relative density of the total neural population immunoreactive for the general neuronal marker protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) than did the adjacent myocardium. A similar density of PGP 9.5-immunoreactive innervation was observed between the sinus node, the transitional region of the atrioventricular node, and the penetrating atrioventricular bundle. A differential pattern of PGP 9.5-immunoreactive innervation was present within the atrioventricular node and between the components of the ventricular conduction tissues, the latter being formed by an intricate network of Purkinje fibres. Numerous ganglion cell bodies were present in the peripheral regions of the sinus node, in the tissues of the atrioventricular groove, and even in the interstices of the compact atrioventricular node. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-containing nerves were the dominant subpopulation observed, representing 60-70% of the total pattern of innervation in the nodal tissues and penetrating atrioventricular bundle. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive nerves were the next most abundant neural subpopulation, representing 37% of the total pattern of innervation in the compact atrioventricular node compared with 25% in the transitional nodal region. A minor population of ganglion cell bodies within the atrioventricular nodal region displayed TH immunoreactivity. The dominant peptidergic nerve supply possessed immunoreactivity for neuropeptide Y (NPY), which displayed a similar pattern of distribution to that of TH-immunoreactive nerve fibres. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-immunoreactive nerves represented 8-9% of the total innervation of the nodal tissues and penetrating atrioventricular bundle, increasing to 14-19% in the bundle branches. Somatostatin-immunoreactive nerve fibres were relatively sparse (4-13% of total innervation) and were most abundant in the nodes, especially the compact atrioventricular node. The total pattern of innervation of the porcine conduction system was relatively homogeneous. A substantial proportion of nerve fibres innervating the nodal tissues could be traced to intracardiac ganglia indicative of an extensive intrinsic supply. The innervation of the atrioventricular node and ventricular conduction tissues was similar to that observed in the bovine heart, but markedly different to that of the human heart. It is important that we are aware of these findings in view of the future use of transgenic pig hearts in human xenotransplantation.},

However, the association of heart rate variability and the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) is not well described. The authors report on the association of baseline cardiac autonomic activity (1987-1989) with incident CHD after 3 years (1990-1992) of follow-up of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study cohort selected from four study centers in the United States by using a case-cohort design. The authors examined 137 incident cases of CHD and a stratified random sample of 2,252 examinees free of CHD at baseline. Baseline, supine, resting beat- to-beat heart rate data were collected. High- (0.16-0.35 Hz) and low- (0.025- 0.15 Hz) frequency spectral powers and high-/low-frequency power ratio, estimated from spectral analysis, and standard deviation of all normal R-R intervals, calculated from time domain analysis, were used as the conventional indices of cardiac parasympathetic, sympatho-parasympathetic, and their balance, respectively. Incident CHD was defined as hospitalized myocardial infarction, fatal CHD, or cardiac revascularization procedures during 3 years of follow-up. The age, race, gender, and other CHD risk factor-adjusted relative risks (and 95% confidence intervals) of incident CHD comparing the lowest quartiles with the upper three quartiles of high- frequency power, low-frequency power, high-/low-frequency power ratio, and standard deviation of R-R intervals were 1.72 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17-2.51), 1.09 (95% CI 0.72-1,64), 1.25 (95% CI 0.84-1.86), and 1.39 (95% CI 0.94-2.04), respectively. The findings from this population-based, prospective study suggest that altered cardiac autonomic activity, especially lower parasympathetic activity, is associated with the risk of developing CHD.},

abstract = {Background: Studies investigating inflammatory markers in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have yielded mixed results. The aim of our study was to compare concentrations of inflammatory markers in patients with PTSD compared with healthy controls. Methods: We did a meta-analysis and meta-regression of studies comparing inflammatory markers between patients with PTSD and healthy controls by searching PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsycINFO for articles published between Jan 1, 1960, and April 7, 2015. From eligible studies (ie, cross-sectional studies or baseline data from longitudinal studies of peripheral blood cytokine concentrations that compared adults with PTSD with healthy controls), we extracted outcomes of interest, such as mean and SD of peripheral blood cytokines, the time of day blood was collected, whether the study allowed patients with comorbid major depressive disorder in the PTSD group, whether patients were medication free, and severity of PTSD symptoms. We undertook meta-analyses whenever values of inflammatory markers were available in two or more studies. A random-effects model with restricted maximum-likelihood estimator was used to synthesise the effect size (assessed by standardised mean difference [SMD]) across studies. Findings: 8057 abstracts were identified and 20 studies were included. Interleukin 6 (SMD 0.88; p=0.0003), interleukin 1$\beta$ (SMD 1.42; p=0.045), and interferon $\gamma$ (SMD 0.49; p=0.002) levels were higher in the PTSD group than in healthy controls. Subgroup meta-analysis of patients who were not given medication showed higher tumour necrosis factor $\alpha$ (TNF$\alpha$ SMD 0.69, 95% CI 0.35-1.02; p<0.0001) in the PTSD group than the control group in addition to the aforementioned cytokines. TNF$\alpha$ (SMD 1.32, 0.13-2.50; p=0.003), interleukin 1$\beta$ (SMD 2.35, 0.01-4.68; p=0.048), and interleukin 6 (SMD 1.75, 0.97-2.53; p<0.0001) levels remained increased in the PTSD group in a subgroup meta-analysis of studies that excluded comorbid major depressive disorder. Illness duration was positively associated with interleukin 1$\beta$ levels (b=0.33, p<0.0001) and severity with interleukin 6 (b=0.02, p=0.042). A model composed of several variables-presence of comorbid major depressive disorder, use of psychotropic medications, assay used, and time of day blood was collected-explained the large amount of heterogeneity between interleukin 1$\beta$, interleukin 6, and C-reactive protein studies. Egger's linear regression test revealed a potential publication bias for interleukin 1$\beta$. Additionally, for most inflammatory markers, study heterogeneity was reported to be high (I2>75%). Interpretation: PTSD is associated with increased interleukin 6, interleukin 1$\beta$, TNF$\alpha$, and interferon $\gamma$ levels. This information might be useful for consideration of chronic low-grade inflammation as a potential target or biomarker in PTSD treatment. Use of psychotropic medication and presence of comorbid major depressive disorder were important moderators that might explain the inconsistency between results of previous studies. Our search strategy used a range of databases and we made exhaustive effort to acquire data by contacting the authors. Notably, high levels of between-study heterogeneity were recorded for most cytokine variables measured in our analysis. However, meta-regression analysis could explain a large amount of this heterogeneity.},

abstract = {ROS Load-free in solution Expansion Contraction Ca 2+ ROS Mechanical load Expansion Contraction Ca 2+ NO Abstract The heart has the ability to adjust to changing mechanical loads. The Frank–Starling law and the Anrep effect describe exquisite intrinsic mechanisms the heart has for autoregulating the force of contraction to maintain cardiac output under changes of preload and afterload. Although these mechanisms have been known for more than a century, their cellular and molecular underpinnings are still debated. How does the cardiac myocyte sense changes in preload or afterload? How does the myocyte adjust its response to compensate for such changes? In cardiac myocytes Ca 2+ is a crucial regulator of contractile force and in this review we compare and contrast recent studies from different labs that address these two important questions. The 'dimensionality' of the mechanical milieu under which experiments are carried out provide important clues to the location of the mechanosensors and the kinds of mechanical forces they can sense and respond to. As a first approximation, sensors inside the myocyte appear to modulate reactive oxygen species while sensors on the cell surface appear to also modulate nitric oxide signalling; both signalling pathways affect Ca 2+ handling. Undoubtedly, further studies will add layers to this simplified picture. Clarifying the intimate links from cellular mechanics to reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide signalling and to Ca 2+ handling will deepen our understanding of the Frank–Starling law and the Anrep effect, and also provide a unified view on how arrhythmias may arise in seemingly disparate diseases that have in common altered myocyte mechanics. Ye Chen-Izu and Leighton T. Izu collaborate in an interdisciplinary team to combine experiments with mathematical modeling for in-depth analyses of the interaction of three dynamics systems – electrical, Ca 2+ signaling, and mechanical systems – that govern cardiac function and heart diseases. Abstract figure legend Surface and internal mechanosensors link to NO and ROS signalling and to Ca 2+ handling. Surface (blue) and internal (red and green) mechanosensors are depicted as springs. In experimental systems where the myocyte is in bathing solution that offers little mechanical resistance, the surface mechanosensors experience little or no strain (change in length divided by original length) as shown in the left panel. The internal mechanosensors experience strain and can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) that affect Ca 2+ handling. In other experimental systems the myocyte is adherent to a stretchable membrane or encased in a viscoelastic gel that provides mechanical resistance as the cell contracts or stretches; this mechanical loading causes surface mechanosensor strain as shown in the right panel. In these systems both internal and surface mechanosensors are activated. We and others have shown that this can result in activation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and production of nitric oxide (NO), which affects Ca},

This study sought to investigate the autonomic mechanism underlying the rapid firings at various sites by systematic ablation of multiple ganglionated plexi (GP).Methods and resultsIn 43 mongrel dogs, rapid firing-mediated atrial fibrillation (AF) was induced by local HFS (200 Hz, impulse duration 0.1 ms, train duration 40 ms) to the PVs and atria during myocardial refractoriness. The main GP in the atrial fat pads or the ganglia along the ligament of Marshall (LOM) were then ablated. Ablation of the anterior right GP and inferior right GP significantly increased the AF threshold by HFS at the right atrium and PVs. The AF threshold at left atrium and PVs was significantly increased by ablation of the superior left GP and inferior left GP, and was further increased by ablation of the LOM. Ablation of left-or right-sided GP on the atria had a significant effect on contralateral PVs and atrium. Administration of esmolol (1 mg/kg) or atropine (1 mg) significantly increased AF threshold at all sites.ConclusionHFS applied to local atrial and PV sites initiated rapid firing via activation of the interactive autonomic network in the heart. GP in either left side or right side contributes to the rapid firings and AF originating from ipsolateral and contralateral PVs and atrium. Autonomic denervation suppresses or eliminates those rapid firings.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this meta-analytic study was to determine whether individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have higher levels of basal cardiovascular activity relative to comparable groups of individuals without PTSD. METHODS: Meta-analytic data methods were applied to 34 studies that gathered indicators of basal cardiovascular activity including: heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure on subjects diagnosed with PTSD and two types of comparison groups. In total, cardiovascular measures were analyzed for 2670 subjects across all studies. RESULTS: Results indicate that individuals with a current PTSD diagnosis have higher resting HR relative to both trauma-exposed individuals without a PTSD diagnosis and non-trauma-exposed individuals. The results also suggest that PTSD is associated with elevations in blood pressure; however, the effect sizes were smaller in magnitude than those obtained for heart rate. A subset analysis revealed that the effect sizes for comparisons on basal HR were greatest in studies with the most chronic PTSD samples. CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis supports previous qualitative reviews, finding a positive association between PTSD and basal cardiovascular activity. The discussion addresses possible mechanisms of action and the health-related implications of these findings.},

abstract = {Reliable and effective noninvasive measures of sympathetic and parasympathetic peripheral outflow are of crucial importance in cardiovascular physiology. Although many techniques have been proposed to take up this long-lasting challenge, none has proposed a satisfying discrimination of the dynamics of the two separate branches. Spectral analysis of heart rate variability is the most currently used technique for such assessment. Despite its widespread use, it has been demonstrated that the subdivision in the low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) bands does not fully reflect separate influences of the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches, respectively, mainly due to their simultaneous action in the LF. Two novel heartbeat-derived autonomic measures, the sympathetic activity index (SAI) and parasympathetic activity index (PAI), are proposed to separately assess the time-varying autonomic nervous system synergic functions. Their efficacy is validated in landmark autonomic maneuvers generally employed in clinical settings. The novel measures move beyond the classical frequency domain paradigm through identification of a set of coefficients associated with a proper combination of Laguerre base functions. The resulting measures were compared with the traditional LF and HF power. A total of 236 ECG recordings were analyzed for validation, including autonomic outflow changes elicited by procedures of different nature and temporal variation, such as postural changes, lower body negative pressure, and handgrip tests. The proposed SAI-PAI measures consistently outperform traditional frequency-domain indexes in tracking expected instantaneous autonomic variations, both vagal and sympathetic, and may aid clinical decision making, showing reduced intersubject variability and physiologically plausible dynamics.NEW & NOTEWORTHY While it is possible to obtain reliable estimates of parasympathetic activity from the ECG, a satisfying method to disentangle the sympathetic component from HRV has not been proposed yet. To overcome this long-lasting limitation, we propose two novel HRV-based indexes, the sympathetic and parasympathetic activity indexes.},

abstract = {Measurement of heart rate variability (HRV) has become an important research tool for both clinical and basic scientists (1,2). The better reproducibility and the possibility of measuring long-range heart rate (HR) fluctuations are advantages of 24-h electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings over short-term recordings in the assessment of HRV (2). Long-range oscillations of HR determine a larger propor-tion of 24-h HRV than do short-term oscillations. This phenomenon can be demonstrated by plotting the (log) power to (log) frequency of HRV in the region of ultra-low-frequency (ULF) and very-low-frequency (VLF) power spectral bands, where an inverse power-law relationship (1/f dynamics) can be observed between the power and the See page 2271 frequency of R-R interval oscillations (2). Similar charac-teristics can also be observed at higher frequencies, except that small peaks in the spectrum exist at the frequency of spontaneous blood pressure oscillations and respiratory fre-quency (2). Origin of long-range HRV. Despite the documented prognostic information obtained by measurements of long-range HRV indexes from 24-h ECG recordings in various patient populations (3–5), the origin of these oscillations and the background of altered long-term HR dynamics are not well established. Lack of this information may be one of the many reasons why the measurement of 24-h HRV has not become a routine tool in clinical practice. From a mathematical viewpoint, long-range HRV, such as standard deviation of the 5-min mean R-R interval (SDANN) and ULF power, can be assumed to be larger when there are large temporal differences in the mean HR between time epochs more than 5 min apart from each other. Another factor that influences the magnitude of these HRV indexes is the average HR itself. The higher the average HR, the lower the HRV, even when the relative fluctuations of HR are similar at high and low HR, respectively. Despite these mathematical assumptions, the reasons for reduced long-range HRV during " free-running " ambulatory conditions have not been systematically studied. In this issue of the Journal, Roach et al. (6) report their results on the effects of changes in the daily activity levels on long-range HRV indexes such as SDANN and the ULF power spectral component (6). In their study, where activity was strictly controlled, SDANN and ULF power were lower during the " rest day " than the " activity day. " Furthermore, the relative contribution of each specific activity to the SDANN value was calculated. On the basis of their obser-vations, the authors conclude that long-range HRV indexes are partly dependent on the range of daily activity (6). Although changes in activity level have evident influences on various indexes of HRV, some caution should be observed in assuming that long-range HRV indexes could simply be used as " surrogates " of individual daily activity and functional state. Although SDANN and ULF power are influenced by the amount and duration of various daily activities, the type of physical activity may have divergent effects on measures of HRV. This is illustrated in Figure 1, where steady-state exercise (i.e., walking at a constant rate and regular activities in the standing position) resulted in a reduction of SDANN, whereas an incremental exercise with a long-term trend in HR resulted in an increase of SDANN. These examples from a previous study (7) dem-onstrate that there is complex interaction between the type and duration of physical activity, average HR, and the indexes of long-range HRV. On the basis of the study by Roach et al. (6) and the observations shown in Figure 1, it is evident that range, duration, and type of activity have obvious effects on various measures of HRV. However, these experiments do not give insight into whether the ULF oscillations of heart period are also determined by periodic or quasiperiodic oscillations of HR originating from an intrinsic regulatory system. Further studies will be needed to address this issue. The postulation of an intrinsic physiologic origin is supported by the notion of a dominant ULF power spectral component, even during strictly controlled resting conditions without any physical activity.},

abstract = {Antiarrhythmic drugs may aggravate or even induce ventricular arrhythmias. This type of adverse reaction is becoming more prevalent as the use of antiarrhythmic agents becomes more widespread. In a retrospective analysis of antiarrhythmic drug action, a worsening of arrhythmia was observed in 80 of 722 (11.1%) antiarrhythmic drug tests in 53 of 155 patients being treated for ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Aggravation of arrhythmias was defined by occurrence of a fourfold increase in the frequency of ventricular premature complexes, a 10-fold increase in repetitive forms, or the first emergence of sustained ventricular tachycardia coincident with time course of action of the particular drug under study. Such aggravation was noted with each of nine drugs tested: quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, propranolol, metoprolol, aprindine, mexiletine, tocainide and pindolol. The frequency of this complication for a specific drug ranged from 5.9-15.8%. Blood drug concentrations were consistently in the therapeutic range. A study of the variability of ventricular arrhythmia during 48-hour Holter monitoring and exercise stress testing in no instance showed arrhythmia enhancement commensurate with that defining aggravation. Our data suggest that this potentially serious complication is not readily predictable and requires a systematic approach to antiarrhythmic drug testing before a patient is prescribed a long-range maintenance program.},

abstract = {The amount of time between heartbeats is controlled by the rate of depolarization of the sinoatrial node. This rate is controlled by a combination of sympathetic and parasympathetic inputs. For this reason, analysis of heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) derived from intervals between normal heart beats provides insights into changing cardiac autonomic function. Increased sympathetic control of the heart from one time point to the next tends to increase HRs, decrease the amount of vagally modulated sinus arrhythmia measured as high-frequency (HF) spectral power, and increase the ratio between low-frequency (LF) spectral power and HF (the LF/HF ratio). Conversely, a shift toward greater vagal control of the heart tends to produce decreased HRs, increases in HF power, and decreases the LF/HF ratio. Clear circadian cycles of HR and HRV are seen in most subjects and correspond to periods of sleep and activity. The magnitude of these cycles is well captured by traditional HRV indices such as deviation of all normal-to-normal (NN) intervals. Cosinor analysis also provides a rough estimate of the magnitude of circadian rhythms. We have observed that HR and HRV fluctuate over time in a cyclic manner in most subjects. Although these cycles are especially prominent during the nighttime, they are seen in the daytime as well. We have developed a number of measures that quantify ultradian properties of HR/HRV cycles and would permit comparisons between subjects. We applied these measures during overnight polysomnography and have shown that ultradian rhythms of cardiac autonomic modulation have a variable and often weak correspondence with traditional sleep stages . In the current study, we applied the methodology developed for the nighttime recordings to 24-h recordings in young healthy subjects and compared these results to those obtained during the nighttime only in the same subjects and in an older group of cardiac patients. Our purpose was to explore the presenc- e and magnitude of ultradian cycles of HRV during the entire 24-h period and during sleep.},

Antiarrhythmic drug therapy has experienced ups and downs during the last 30 years balancing high antiarrhythmic potential, toxic side effects and pro-arrhythmic potency. Therefore, the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) remains irreplaceable in primary and secondary prevention of SCD. Hybrid therapy combing antiarrhythmic drugs (predominantly amiodarone) with ICD therapy represents an often-used treatment option.

The physiological mechanisms accounting for this association are unclear. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal dysregulation, diminished heart rate variability, altered blood platelet function and noncompliance with medial treatments have been proposed as mechanisms underlying depression and cardiovascular disease. Recent evidence also suggests that reduced baroreflex sensitivity, impaired immune function, chronic fatigue and the co-morbidity of depression and anxiety may be involved in the relationship between depression and cardiovascular dysregulation. An experimental strategy using animal models for investigating underlying physiological abnormalities in depression is presented. A key to understanding the bidirectional association between depression and heart disease is to determine whether there are common changes in brain systems that are associated with these conditions. Such approaches may hold promise for advancing our understanding of the interaction between this mood disorder and CAD. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

HRV is affected by breathing parameters, yet debate remains regarding the best breathing interventions for strengthening HRV. The objective of the current study was to test whether the inclusion of a postexhalation rest period was effective at increasing HRV, while controlling for breathing rate. A within-subject crossover design was used with 40 participants who were assigned randomly to a breathing pattern including a postexhalation rest period or a breathing pattern that omitted the postexhalation rest period. Participants completed training on each breathing pattern, practiced for 6 min, and sat quietly during a 5-min washout period between practices. Participants were given instructions for diaphragmatic breathing at a pace of six breaths/minute with or without a postexhalation rest period. Recordings of heart rate, breathing rate, HF-HRV, RMSSD, LF-HRV, and SDNN were collected before and during each of the breathing trials. HRV indices were derived from Lead 1 ECG recordings. Pairwise contrasts showed that inclusion of a postexhalation rest period significantly decreased heart rate (p < .001) and increased HF-HRV (p < .05). No differences were found for breathing rates (p > .05), RMSSD (p > .05), and SDNN (p > .05). Results indicated that omission of the postexhalation rest period resulted in higher LF-HRV (p < .05). A postexhalation rest period improves HF-HRV, commonly associated with self-regulatory control, yet the importance of a postexhalation rest period requires further exploration.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increased research attention is being paid to the negative impact of anger on coronary heart disease (CHD). METHODS AND RESULTS: This study examined prospectively the association between trait anger and the risk of combined CHD (acute myocardial infarction [MI]/fatal CHD, silent MI, or cardiac revascularization procedures) and of "hard" events (acute MI/fatal CHD). Participants were 12 986 black and white men and womenenrolled in the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities study. In the entire cohort, individuals with high trait anger, compared with their low anger counterparts, were at increased risk of CHD in both event categories. The multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) (95% CI) was 1.54 (95% CI 1.10 to 2.16) for combined CHD and 1.75 (95% CI 1.17 to 2.64) for "hard" events. Heterogeneity of effect was observed by hypertensive status. Among normotensive individuals, the risk of combined CHD and of "hard" events increased monotonically with increasing levels of trait anger. The multivariate-adjusted HR of CHD for high versus low anger was 2.20 (95% CI 1.36 to 3.55) and for moderate versus low anger was 1.32 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.84). For "hard" events, the multivariate-adjusted HRs were 2.69 (95% CI 1.48 to 4.90) and 1.35 (95% CI 0.87 to 2.10), respectively. No statistically significant association between trait anger and incident CHD risk was observed among hypertensive individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Proneness to anger places normotensive middle-aged men and women at significant risk for CHD morbidity and death independent of the established biological risk factors.},

abstract = {Following the publication of the Task Force document on heart rate variability (HRV) in 1996, a number of articles have been published to describe new HRV methodologies and their application in different physiological and clinical studies. This document presents a critical review of the new methods. A particular attention has been paid to methodologies that have not been reported in the 1996 standardization document but have been more recently tested in sufficiently sized populations. The following methods were considered: Long-range correlation and fractal analysis; Short-term complexity; Entropy and regularity; and Nonlinear dynamical systems and chaotic behaviour. For each of these methods, technical aspects, clinical achievements, and suggestions for clinical application were reviewed. While the novel approaches have contributed in the technical understanding of the signal character of HRV, their success in developing new clinical tools, such as those for the identification of high-risk patients, has been rather limited. Available results obtained in selected populations of patients by specialized laboratories are nevertheless of interest but new prospective studies are needed. The investigation of new parameters, descriptive of the complex regulation mechanisms of heart rate, has to be encouraged because not all information in the HRV signal is captured by traditional methods. The new technologies thus could provide after proper validation, additional physiological, and clinical meaning. Multidisciplinary dialogue and specialized courses in the combination of clinical cardiology and complex signal processing methods seem warranted for further advances in studies of cardiac oscillations and in the understanding normal and abnormal cardiac control processes.},

abstract = {Background: The usefulness of heart rate variability (HRV) as a clinical research and diagnostic tool has been verified in numerous studies. The gold standard technique comprises analyzing time series of RR intervals from an electrocardiographic signal. However, some authors have used pulse cycle intervals instead of RR intervals, as they can be determined from a pulse wave (e.g. a photoplethysmographic) signal. This option is often called pulse rate variability (PRV), and utilizing it could expand the serviceability of pulse oximeters or simplify ambulatory monitoring of HRV. Methods: We review studies investigating the accuracy of PRV as an estimate of HRV, regardless of the underlying technology (photoplethysmography, continuous blood pressure monitoring or Finapresi, impedance plethysmography). Results/conclusions: Results speak in favor of sufficient accuracy when subjects are at rest, although many studies suggest that short-term variability is somewhat overestimated by PRV, which reflects coupling effects between respiration and the cardiovascular system. Physical activity and some mental stressors seem to impair the agreement of PRV and HRV, often to an inacceptable extent. Findings regarding the position of the sensor or the detection algorithm are not conclusive. Generally, quantitative conclusions are impeded by the fact that results of different studies are mostly incommensurable due to diverse experimental settings and/or methods of analysis. {\textcopyright} 2012 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {The role of pressor sympathetic reflexes in circulatory control was investigated in conscious dogs. Animals were previously instrumented with a 6- to 8-cm rigid core cannula covered by an inflatable rubber cylinder in the thoracic aorta, a pressure catheter implanted in the aorta above the cannula, and a second catheter inserted into the aorta below the cannula through a femoral artery. Two piezoelectric crystals were positioned at opposing adventitial sites to measure aortic distension with ultrasound techniques. After recovery from surgery, the diameter of the aortic segment surrounding the cannula was increased by 9.6 +/- 0.4% from 16 +/- 1 mm by inflating the rubber cylinder, without obstructing blood flow. Mean aortic pressure rose 31 +/- 3% from 100 +/- 3 mm Hg and heart rate 20 +/- 3% from 91 +/- 3 beats/min (P less than 0.01). The pressor response was abolished by alpha-adrenergic blockade (phentolamine 1 mg/kg, iv). The heart rate response was reduced either by beta-blockade (propranolol 1 mg/kg, iv) or muscarinic blockade (atropine 0.2 mg/kg, iv) and abolished by their combination. During aortic stretch, the sensitivity of the baroreflex was reduced 57 +/- 7% from 18 +/- 2 msec/mm Hg (P less than 0.01). The pressor response was increased by 49 +/- 8% after bilateral carotid sinus nerve section and vagotomy. These excitatory reflex responses were obtained in absence of any pain reaction. Thus, in the conscious dog, aortic distension within physiological ranges induces a potent pressor sympathetic reflex with positive feedback characteristics. Such a pressor reflex not only occurs in the presence of functioning baroreflexes, but is also capable of reducing their sensitivity.},

abstract = {Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) with adenosine-stress myocardial perfusion is gaining importance for the detection and quantification of coronary artery disease (CAD). However, there is little knowledge about patients with CMR-detected ischemia, but having no relevant stenosis as seen on coronary angiography (CA). The aims of our study were to characterize these patients by CMR and CA and evaluate correlations and potential reasons for the ischemic findings. 73 patients with an indication for CA were first scanned on a 1.5T whole-body CMR-scanner including adenosine-stress first-pass perfusion. The images were analyzed by two independent investigators for myocardial perfusion which was classified as subendocardial ischemia (n = 22), no perfusion deficit (n = 27, control 1), or more than subendocardial ischemia (n = 24, control 2). All patients underwent CA, and a highly significant correlation between the classification of CMR perfusion deficit and the degree of coronary luminal narrowing was found. For quantification of coronary blood flow, corrected Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) frame count (TFC) was evaluated for the left anterior descending (LAD), circumflex (LCX) and right coronary artery (RCA). The main result was that corrected TFC in all coronaries was significantly increased in study patients compared to both control 1 and to control 2 patients. Study patients had hypertension or diabetes more often than control 1 patients. In conclusion, patients with CMR detected subendocardial ischemia have prolonged coronary blood flow. In connection with normal resting flow values in CAD, this supports the hypothesis of underlying coronary microvascular impairment. CMR stress perfusion differentiates non-invasively between this entity and relevant CAD.},

abstract = {Objectives The aim of this study was to determine whether post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) using a prospective twin study design and objective measures of CHD. Background It has long been hypothesized that PTSD increases the risk of CHD, but empirical evidence using objective measures is limited. Methods We conducted a prospective study of middle-aged male twins from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Among twin pairs without self-reported CHD at baseline, we selected pairs discordant for a lifetime history of PTSD, pairs discordant for a lifetime history of major depression, and pairs without either condition. All underwent a clinic visit after a median follow-up of 13 years. Outcomes included clinical events (myocardial infarction, other hospitalizations for CHD and coronary revascularization) and quantitative measures of myocardial perfusion by [13N] ammonia positron emission tomography, including a stress total severity score and coronary flow reserve. Results A total of 562 twins (281 pairs) with a mean age of 42.6 years at baseline were included in this study. The incidence of CHD was more than double in twins with PTSD (22.6%) than in those without PTSD (8.9%; p < 0.001). The association remained robust after adjusting for lifestyle factors, other risk factors for CHD, and major depression (odds ratio: 2.2; 95% confidence interval: 1.2 to 4.1). Stress total severity score was significantly higher (+95%, p = 0.001) and coronary flow reserve was lower (-0.21, p = 0.02) in twins with PTSD than in those without PTSD, denoting worse myocardial perfusion. Associations were only mildly attenuated in 117 twin pairs discordant for PTSD. Conclusions Among Vietnam-era veterans, PTSD is a risk factor for CHD. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation Published by Elsevier Inc.},

The topic of this review has incited perennial debate, because of disagreements over definitions, controversial inferences, and limited availability of relevant measurement tools. The discussion begins appropriately with Cannon's "homeostasis" and his pioneering work in the area. This is followed by mental stress as a scientific idea and the relatively new notions of allostasis and allostatic load. Experimental models of mental stress in rodents and humans are discussed, with particular attention to ethical constraints in humans. Sections follow on sympathoneural responses to mental stress, reactivity of catecholamine systems, clinical pathophysiologic states, and the cardiovascular reactivity hypothesis. Future advancement of the field will require integrative approaches and coordinated efforts between physiologists and psychologists on this interdisciplinary topic.},

abstract = {Background: Limited data suggest that the AHA Heart Healthy score (Life's Simple 7TM; AHA score) is inversely associated with the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the biological mechanisms that underlie this association have not been elucidated. Methods & Results: We investigated the association between the AHA Score and concentrations of circulating biomarkers and prevalent subclinical CVD (defined using a validated index consisting of at least one of the following: increased carotid intima media thickness or stenosis; left ventricular hypertrophy (by ECG or echocardiography) or systolic dysfunction (by echocardiography); microalbuminuria; and a reduced ankle-brachial index) in up to 2680 Framingham Offspring Study participants (mean age 58 years, 55% women). We hypothesized that any observed association between the AHA score and incident CVD may be mediated by the association between the score and biomarker levels and the presence of subclinical disease. Adjusting for age & sex, an ideal AHA score (non-smoking status, ideal body mass index, regular physical activity, healthy diet, and an optimal profile of total serum cholesterol, blood pressure, and glucose; range 0-7) was associated with: a. higher concentrations of natriuretic peptides (NT-proANP & B-type natriuretic peptide) and lower concentrations of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, aldosterone, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, fibrinogen, homocysteine, and growth differentiation factor-15 levels (p<0.001 for all); and b. lower odds of subclinical disease (Odds Ratio 0.73 per unit increase in the AHA score, 95% CI 0.68, 0.80). The incidence of CVD (267 events over 16 years) was inversely associated with the baseline AHA score in age-, sex- adjusted models (Hazards ratio [HR] 0.78 per unit-increase in the AHA score, 95% CI 0.70, 0.86) that was slightly attenuated upon adjustment for biomarkers and subclinical disease (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79, 0.98). Conclusion: In our prospective study of a large community-based sample, an ideal AHA score (indicating ideal cardiovascular health) was inversely associated with the incidence of CVD, an association partly attributable to its favorable impact on CVD biomarker levels and subclinical disease},

abstract = {Background: Research on the etiology of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has rapidly matured, moving from candidate gene studies to interrogation of the entire human genome in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we present the results of a GWAS performed on samples from combat-exposed U.S. Marines and Sailors from the Marine Resiliency Study (MRS) scheduled for deployment to Iraq and/or Afghanistan. The MRS is a large, prospective study with longitudinal follow-up designed to identify risk and resiliency factors for combat-induced stress-related symptoms. Previously implicated PTSD risk loci from the literature and polygenic risk scores across psychiatric disorders were also evaluated in the MRS cohort. Methods: Participants (. N=. 3494) were assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale and diagnosed using the DSM-IV diagnostic criterion. Subjects with partial and/or full PTSD diagnosis were called cases, all other subjects were designated controls, and study-wide maximum CAPS scores were used for longitudinal assessments. Genomic DNA was genotyped on the Illumina HumanOmniExpressExome array. Individual genetic ancestry was determined by supervised cluster analysis for subjects of European, African, Hispanic/Native American, and other descent. To test for association of SNPs with PTSD, logistic regressions were performed within each ancestry group and results were combined in meta-analyses. Measures of childhood and adult trauma were included to test for gene-by-environment (GxE) interactions. Polygenic risk scores from the Psychiatric Genomic Consortium were used for major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BPD), and schizophrenia (SCZ). Results: The array produced >800K directly genotyped and >21M imputed markers in 3494 unrelated, trauma-exposed males, of which 940 were diagnosed with partial or full PTSD. The GWAS meta-analysis identified the phosphoribosyl transferase domain containing 1 gene (PRTFDC1) as a genome-wide significant PTSD locus (rs6482463; OR=1.47, SE=0.06, p=2.04×10-9), with a similar effect across ancestry groups. Association of PRTFDC1 with PTSD in an independent military cohort showed some evidence for replication. Loci with suggestive evidence of association (n=25 genes, p<5×10-6) further implicated genes related to immune response and the ubiquitin system, but these findings remain to be replicated in larger GWASs. A replication analysis of 25 putative PTSD genes from the literature found nominally significant SNPs for the majority of these genes, but associations did not remain significant after correction for multiple comparison. A cross-disorder analysis of polygenic risk scores from GWASs of BPD, MDD, and SCZ found that PTSD diagnosis was associated with risk sores of BPD, but not with MDD or SCZ. Conclusions: This first multi-ethnic/racial GWAS of PTSD highlights the potential to increase power through meta-analyses across ancestry groups. We found evidence for PRTFDC1 as a potential novel PTSD gene, a finding that awaits further replication. Our findings indicate that the genetic architecture of PTSD may be determined by many SNPs with small effects, and overlap with other neuropsychiatric disorders, consistent with current findings from large GWAS of other psychiatric disorders.},

abstract = {The purpose of this article is to review the nerve sprouting hypothesis of sudden cardiac death. It is known that sympathetic stimulation is important in the generation of sudden cardiac death. For example, there is a diurnal variation of sudden death rate in patients with myocardial infarction. Beta blockers, or drugs with beta blocking effects, are known to prevent sudden cardiac death. It was unclear if the cardiac nerves in the heart play only a passive role in the mechanisms of sudden death. To determine if nerve sprouting and neural remodeling occur after myocardial infarction, we performed immunocytochemical studies of cardiac nerves in explanted native hearts of transplant recipients. We found that there was a positive correlation between nerve density and a clinical history of ventricular arrhythmia. Encouraged by these results, we performed a study in dogs to determine whether or not nerve growth factor (NGF) infusion to the left stellate ganglion can facilitate the development of ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF), and sudden cardiac death (SCD). The results showed that augmented myocardial sympathetic nerve sprouting through NGF infusion plus atrioventricular (AV) block and MI result in a 44% incidence (four of nine dogs) of SCD and a high incidence of VT in the chronic phase of MI. In contrast, none of the six dogs (with AV block and MI) without NGF infusion died suddenly or had frequent VT episodes. Based on these findings, we propose the nerve sprouting hypothesis of ventricular arrhythmia and SCD. The hypothesis states that MI results in nerve injury, followed by sympathetic nerve sprouting and regional (heterogeneous) myocardial hyperinnervation. The coupling between augmented sympathetic nerve sprouting with electrically remodeled myocardium results in VT, VF and SCD. Modification of nerve sprouting after MI may provide a novel opportunity for arrhythmia control. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Notably, one aspect of PTSD, particularly in veterans, is its comorbidity with suicide. Elevated aggressiveness predicts high-risk to suicide in humans and despite the difficulty in reproducing a complex human suicidal behavior in rodents, aggressive behavior is a well reproducible behavioral trait of suicide. PTSD animal models are based on a peculiar phenotype, including exaggerated fear memory, anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors associated with neurochemical dysregulations in emotional brain circuitry. The endocannabinoid and the neurosteroid systems regulate emotions and stress responses, and recent evidence shows these two systems are interrelated and critically compromised in neuropsychiatric disorders. For instance, levels of the neurosteroid, allopregnanolone, as well as those of the endocannabinoids, anandamide and its congener, palmitoylethanolamide are decreased in PTSD. Similarly, the endocannabinoid system and neurosteroid biosynthesis are altered in suicidal individuals. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the only FDA-approved treatments for PTSD and depression, fail to help half of the treatment-seeking patients. This highlights the need for developing biomarker-based efficient therapies. One promising hypothesis points to stimulation of allopregnanolone biosynthesis as a valid end-point to predict treatment response in PTSD patients. This review highlights running findings on the role of the endocannabinoid and neurosteroid systems in PTSD and suicidal behavior both in a preclinical and clinical perspective. A specific focus is given to predictive PTSD/suicide animal models. Ultimately, we discuss the idea that disruption of neurosteroid and endocannabinoid biosynthesis may offer novel promising biomarker candidates to develop new treatments for PTSD and, perhaps, suicidal behavior.},

abstract = {The effects of increased and decreased cardiac sympathetic tone and coronary occlusion on ventricular fibrillation threshold were determined in 14 open chest dogs anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. Heart rate was kept constant by pacing the right atrium at cycle lengths of 500 msec. Ventricular fibrillation threshold was measured by delivering 350 msec trains of constant current stimuli with a frequency of 100 hertz and 2 msec duration. The minimal current of the train that induced fibrillation was taken as the ventricular fibrillation threshold. In seven animals, the effects of stellate stimulation were studied. Ventricular fibrillation threshold was measured during control periods, after 2 minutes of coronary occlusion, after 2 minutes of stellate stimulation and after 2 minutes of stellate stimulation and coronary occlusion. Coronary occlusion alone decreased ventricular fibrillation threshold an average of 35 percent of control values and stellate stimulation alone decreased the threshold an average of 42 percent of control values. The combination of both these Interventions decreased ventricular fibrillation threshold an average of 63 percent of control values. The effects of stellate ablation were studied in seven animals. Ventricular fibrillation threshold was measured during control periods, and during coronary occlusion before and after stellate ganglionectomy. Stellectomy increased the threshold an average of 31 percent above control values. After stellectomy, coronary occlusion decreased ventricular fibrillation threshold by only 11 percent of control values, a value 26 percent higher than the threshold during coronary occlusion before stellectomy. These findings may have therapeutic implications for the management of arrhythmias in patients with acute myocardial infarction or some forms of central nervous system disease. {\textcopyright} 1975.},

METHODS We prospectively enrolled patients with confirmed CAD in the Mental Stress Ischemia Prognosis Study (MIPS) between 2011 and 2014. All patients underwent mental stress testing using a standardized public speaking task, and ischemia was detected by Tc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging. Patients also underwent conventional stress testing for myocardial ischemia (CSIMI) using exercise or pharmacological stress testing. Furthermore, digital microvascular flow, endothelial function, arterial stiffness, and blood sample collections were performed before, during, and after mental stress. Two-year adverse clinical outcomes are being assessed. RESULTS Six-hundred ninety-five patients completed baseline enrollment in the MIPS. Their mean (standard deviation) age was 62.9 (9.1) years, 72% were men, 30% were African American, and 32% had a history myocardial infarction. The prevalence of MSIMI and CSIMI is 16.1% and 34.7%, respectively. A total of 151 patients (22.9%) had only CSIMI, 28 (4.2%) had only MSIMI, and 78 (11.8%) had both MSIMI and CSIMI. Patients with ischemia had a lower ejection fraction and higher prevalence of previous coronary artery bypass grafting compared with those without inducible ischemia (p < .050). The prevalence of obstructive CAD was not statistically different between patients with and without MSIMI (p = .426); in contrast, it was higher in patients with CSIMI (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS The MIPS data will provide useful information to assess the prognostic significance and underlying mechanisms of MSIMI.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Sympathovagal imbalance (SVI) has been reported to be associated with metabolic derangements in type 2 diabetes. We investigated the association of SVI with cognitive impairment in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS Patients with a new diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (n=43) and age-matched healthy control subjects (n=43) were recruited for the study. Body mass index and blood pressure measurements were recorded. SVI was assessed by spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV), and cognitive function was assessed by recording the positive wave that appears in 300 milliseconds from application of stimulus in event-related potential tracing (P300). Insulin resistance was determined by the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) formula using blood glucose and insulin data, and oxidative stress was assessed by estimation of malondialdehyde. Association of various factors with cognitive impairment was evaluated by Pearson correlation analysis, and independent contributions of these factors to cognitive impairment were assessed by multiple regression analysis. RESULTS P300 latency was significantly prolonged in the diabetes group compared with the control group. Ratio of low-frequency to high-frequency power (LF-HF ratio) of HRV, the marker of SVI was found to be significantly correlated and linked with P300. Malondialdehyde and HOMA-IR were correlated with LF-HF ratio. CONCLUSION Treatment-na{\"{i}}ve patients with type 2 diabetes have SVI and considerable cognitive impairment. Insulin resistance and oxidative stress contribute to cognitive impairment, and SVI could be the physiologic link to cognitive impairment in treatment-na{\"{i}}ve patients with type 2 diabetes.},

abstract = {1. The electrophysiological properties of intracardiac neurones cultured from ganglia within the atria and interatrial septum of the new-born guinea-pig heart were studied using intracellular micro-electrodes. 2. Three types of neurones with resting membrane potentials in the range -45 to -76 mV were detected. The first type, AHs cells, had high (15-28 mV) firing thresholds, pronounced slow post-spike after-hyperpolarizations and fired only once to prolonged intrasomal current injection. The second type, AHm cells, were similar to AHs cells, except that they could fire short bursts of spikes (100-400 ms) at the onset of current injection. The third type, M cells, had low firing thresholds (10-15 mV), no slow after-hyperpolarizations and produced non-adapting trains of action potentials in response to depolarizing current injection. 3. The generation of action potentials in M cells was prevented by tetrodotoxin (TTX; 0.3 microM), whereas in AHs and AHm cells action potentials displayed a channel blockade using solutions containing the divalent cations cadmium, cobalt or manganese (0.02-1 mM). 4. The post-spike after-hyperpolarization in AHs and AHm cells was abolished by the removal of extracellular calcium, shortened in solutions containing the calcium entry blockers CdCl2, MnSO4 and CoCl2 (0.02-1 mM) and prolonged by the addition of calcium (5.0 mM), tetraethylammonium (1-3 mM), 4-aminopyridine (1-3 mM), cyanide (10 microM) or caffeine (100 microM) to the perfusate. 5. The reversal potential of the post-spike after-hyperpolarization was -89.1 mV. This value changed by 62.9 mV for a 10-fold increase in extracellular potassium concentration. 6. The peak conductance change during the post-spike after-hyperpolarization (gK,Ca), was largely independent of membrane potential between -50 and -110 mV. The peak increase in gK,Ca and the duration of the after-hyperpolarization increased with the number of spikes preceding it. 7. It is concluded that calcium entry during the action potential is responsible for the activation of an outward potassium current in the two types of AH cells; the roles played by intracellular calcium extrusion as well as sequestration mechanisms in the generation of the response are discussed.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV), the changes in the beat-to-beat heart rate calculated from the electrocar- diogram (ECG), is a key indicator of an individual's cardiovascular condition. Assessment of HRV has been shown to aid clinical diagnosis and intervention strategies. However, the variety of HRV estima- tion methods and contradictory reports in this field indicate that there is a need for a more rigorous investigation of these methods as aids to clinical evaluation. This thesis investigates the development of appropriate HRV signal processing techniques in the context of pilot studies in two fields of potential application, sleep and head-up tilting (HUT). A novel method for characterising normality in the ECG using both timing information and morpho- logical characteristics is presented. A neural network, used to learn the beat-to-beat variations in ECG waveform morphology, is shown to provide a highly sensitive technique for identifying normal beats. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based frequency-domain HRV techniques, which require re-sampling of the inherently unevenly sampled heart beat time-series (RR tachogram) to produce an evenly sampled time series, are then explored using a newmethod for producing an artificial RRtachogram. Re-sampling is shown to produce a significant error in the estimation of an (entirely specified) artificial RR tachogram. The Lomb periodogram, a method which requires no re-sampling and is applicable to the unevenly sampled nature of the signal is investigated. Experiments demonstrate that the Lomb periodogram is superior to the FFT for evaluating HRV measured by the ?? -ratio, a ratio of the low to high frequency ?? power in the RR tachogram within a specified band (0.04–0.4Hz). The effect of adding artificial ectopic beats in the RR tachogram is then considered and it is shown that ectopic beats significantly alter the spectrum and therefore must be removed or replaced. Replacing ectopic beats by phantom beats is compared to the case of ectopic-realted RR interval removal for the FFT and Lomb methods for varying levels of ectopy. The Lomb periodogram is shown to provide a significantly better estimate of the ?? - ?? ratio under these conditions and is a robust method for measuring the ?? -ratio in the presence of (a ?? possibly unknown number of) ectopic beats or artefacts. The Lomb periodogram and FFT-based techniques are applied to a database of sleep apn ? ic and normal subjects. A new method of assessing HRVduring sleep is proposed to minimise the confounding effects on HRV of changes due to changing mental activity. Estimation of ?? -ratio using the Lomb ?? technique is shown to separate these two patient groups more effectively than with FFT-based techniques. Results are also presented for the application of these methods to controlled (HUT) studies on subjects with syncope, an autonomic nervous system problem, which indicate that the techniques developed in this thesis may provide a method for differentiating between sub-classes of syncope},

abstract = {Objectives: This study sought to examine the relationship between inflammation and coronary microvascular function in asymptomatic individuals using positron emission tomography (PET) and assessment of coronary flow reserve (CFR). Background: Coronary microvascular dysfunction is an early precursor of coronary artery disease (CAD) thought to result from endothelial cell activation and inflammation, but data are limited. Methods: We examined 268 asymptomatic male monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Plasma biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial cell activation included C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, white blood cell count (WBC), vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1. Blood flow quantitation was obtained with [13N] ammonia PET at rest and after adenosine stress. CFR was measured as the ratio of maximum flow to baseline flow at rest; abnormal CFR was defined as a ratio <2.5. A summed stress score for visible perfusion defects was calculated. Results: In within-pair analyses, all biomarkers, except VCAM-1, were higher in twins with lower CFR than their brothers with higher CFR (p < 0.05). This was observed in the entire sample, as well as within pairs discordant for a CFR of <2.5. Associations persisted after adjusting for summed stress score and CAD risk factors. In contrast no biomarker, except IL-6, was related to the summed stress score of visible defects. Conclusions: Even in asymptomatic subjects, a decrease in coronary microvascular function is accompanied by a systemic inflammatory response, independent of CAD risk factors. Our results, using a controlled twin design, highlight the importance of coronary microvascular function in the early phases of CAD. {\textcopyright} 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {Abstract Variability metrics hold promise as potential indicators for autonomic function, prediction of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, psychophysiological status, and general wellness. Although the investigation of heart rate variability (HRV) has been prevalent for several decades, the methods used for preprocessing, windowing, and choosing appropriate parameters lacks consensus among academic and clinical investigators. Moreover, many of the important steps are omitted from publications, preventing reproducibility. To address this, we have compiled a comprehensive and open-source modular toolbox for calculating HRV metrics and other related variability indices, on both raw cardiovascular time series, and RR intervals. The software, known as the PhysioNet Cardiovascular Signal Toolbox, is implemented in the MATLAB programming language, with standard (open) input and output formats, and requires no external libraries. The functioning of our software is compared with other widely used and referenced HRV toolboxes to identify important differences. Our findings demonstrate how modest differences in the approach to HRV analysis can lead to divergent results, a factor that might have contributed to the lack of repeatability of studies and clinical applicability of HRV metrics. Existing HRV toolboxes do not include standardized preprocessing, signal quality indices (for noisy segment removal), and abnormal rhythm detection and are therefore likely to lead to significant errors in the presence of moderate to high noise or arrhythmias. We therefore describe the inclusion of validated tools to address these issues. We also make recommendations for default values and testing/reporting.},

abstract = {Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with coronary heart disease (CHD), but the mechanisms are unclear. The presence of MDD may increase CHD risk by affecting microvascular circulation. It is also plausible that genetic factors influencing MDD may overlap with those for CHD. We sought to examine the relationship between MDD and coronary flow reserve (CFR), the ratio of maximum flow during stress to flow at rest measured in milliliters per minute per gram of tissue. Methods We examined 289 male middle-aged twins, including 106 twins (53 twin pairs) discordant for a lifetime history of MDD and 183 control twins (unrelated to any twins in the experimental group) without MDD. To calculate CFR, we used positron emission tomography with nitrogen 13 (13N) ammonia to evaluate myocardial blood flow at rest and after adenosine stress. A standard perfusion defect score was also used to assess myocardial ischemia. Results There was no difference in myocardial ischemia between twins with and without MDD. Among the dizygotic twin pairs discordant for MDD, the CFR was 14% lower in the twins with MDD than in their brothers without MDD (2.36 vs 2.74) (P = .03). This association was not present in the monozygotic discordant pairs who were genetically matched (2.86 vs 2.64) (P = .19). The zygosity-MDD interaction after adjustment was significant (P = .006). The CFR in the dizygotic twins with MDD was also lower than in the control twins. Conclusions Our results provide evidence for a shared genetic pathway between MDD and microvascular dysfunction. Common pathophysiologic processes may link MDD and early atherosclerosis.},

abstract = {Background Patients with microvascular angina (exertional angina, positive exercise tests and normal coronary arteriograms) usually have a reduced coronary blood flow reserve. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a potent endogenous vasoconstrictor involved in modulation of coronary vasomotor tone and may play a role in microvascular angina. Methods We compared the effects of NPY (0.2–1.0 pmol/kg, intracoronary) on the vasomotor response of proximal and distal segments of the coronary arteries in 7 patients with microvascular angina, 9 with chronic stable angina, and 9 control individuals. The coronary response to the administration of ergonovine was also assessed in 9 other patients with microvascular angina. Computerized coronary artery diameter measurements were carried out before (baseline) and after the administration of the vasoactive agents. Results Mean baseline coronary lumen diameters were similar in control, microvascular angina, and coronary artery disease patients. NPY constricted proximal coronary segments by 8 ± 2%, 5 ± 2% and 6 ± 3% and distal segments by 14 ± 2%, 11 ± 2% and 10 ± 2% in control, microvascular angina, and coronary artery disease patients, respectively (p = NS between groups). In patients with microvascular angina, ergonovine constricted proximal coronary segments by 7 ± 1.5% and distal segments by 12.5 ± 3% (p = NS vs. NPY). During NPY administration four microvascular angina patients developed chest pain, ST segment depression, and a marked lengthening of the contrast medium run off, in the absence of epicardial coronary artery spasm. Control individuals and coronary artery disease patients did not experience chest pain, ST segment shifts, or lengthening of the run off during NPY administration. Ergonovine administration caused chest pain and lengthening of the contrast run-off, in the absence of epicardial coronary artery spasm, in one microvascular angina patient. Conclusions Exogenous NPY causes mild epicardial coronary artery constriction which is similar in patients with non-cardiac chest pain, microvascular angina and coronary artery disease. Myocardial ischemia and marked lengthening of the contrast run off in response to NPY occurred in microvascular angina patients but not in control or coronary artery disease patients. An abnormal constrictor response to NPY at the microcirculation level could be the mechanism underlying the ischemic manifestations observed in patients with microvascular angina. Condensed abstract (table of contents) The vasomotor response of proximal and distal coronary artery segments was studied in twenty five patients: 7 microvascular angina, 9 chronic stable angina, and 9 control subjects. Computerized measurements of coronary diameters were carried out before and after the intracoronary administration of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and ergonovine. Constriction of epicardial arteries in response to NPY was mild and not significantly different in control, microvascular angina and coronary artery disease patients. Ergonovine-induced epicardial coronary artery constriction was similar to that of NPY. However, NPY caused transient myocardial ischemia in patients with microvascular angina (probably through constriction of the small intramyocardial vessels), but not in control subjects or coronary artery disease patients.},

abstract = {Adenosine plays an important role in postischemic dysfunction of cardiac sympathetic nerves because exogenously infused adenosine produces and adenosine deaminase prevents "neural stunning." We examined whether adenosine acts via a specific receptor mechanism to produce neural stunning. Anesthetized dogs were treated with propranolol to attenuate increases in coronary flow due to adrenergic stimulation of myocardial metabolism. A 15-min occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) attenuated subsequent LAD coronary vasoconstriction to bilateral sympathetic stimulation during reperfusion by 75% (P < 0.05). Coronary infusion of the adenosine-receptor antagonist 8-p-sulfophenyltheophylline (nonspecific), 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (A1 specific), or 3,7-dimethyl-1-propagylxanthine (A2 specific) during LAD occlusion prevented the attenuation of sympathetic coronary constriction. In separate experiments, either the specific adenosine agonist N6-cyclopentyl-adenosine (A1 specific) or CGS-21680 (A2 specific) or a combination of both agonists was infused into the LAD for 15 min. Neither agonist alone attenuated subsequent sympathetic coronary constriction. In contrast, 15 min after the combined administration of both agonists, sympathetic vasoconstriction was reduced. We conclude that adenosine is capable of attenuating neurogenic coronary constriction through a receptor-mediated mechanism. Activation of more than one receptor subtype is necessary to produce neural stunning.},

abstract = {We hypothesized that selective control of ventricular contractility might be mediated by postganglionic parasympathetic neurons in the cranial medial ventricular (CMV) ganglion plexus located in a fat pad at the base of the aorta. Sinus rate, atrioventricular (AV) conduction (ventricular rate during atrial pacing), and left ventricular contractile force (LV dP/dt during right ventricular pacing) were measured in eight chloralose-anesthetized dogs both before and during bilateral cervical vagus stimulation (20-30 V, 0.5 ms pulses, 15-20 Hz). Seven of these dogs were tested under beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol, 0.8 mg kg -1 i.v.). Control responses included sinus node bradycardia or arrest during spontaneous rhythm, high grade AV block or complete heart block, and a 30% decrease in contractility from 2118 ± 186 to 1526 ± 187 mm Hg s -1 (P < 0.05). Next, the ganglionic blocker trimethaphan (0.3-1.0 ml of a 50 $\mu$g ml -1 solution) was injected into the CMV fat pad. Then vagal stimulation was repeated, which now produced a relatively small 5% (N.S., P > 0.05) decrease in contractility but still elicited the same degree of sinus bradycardia and AV block (N = 8, P < 0.05). Five dogs were re-tested 3 h after trimethaphan fat pad injection, at which time blockade of vagally-induced negative inotropy was partially reversed, as vagal stimulation decreased LV dP/dt by 19%. The same dose of trimethaphan given either locally into other fat pads (PVFP or IVC-ILA) or systemically (i.v.) had no effect on vagally-induced negative inotropy. Thus, parasympathetic ganglia located in the CMV fat pad mediated a decrease in ventricular contractility during vagal stimulation. Blockade of the CMV fat pad had no effect on vagally-mediated slowing of sinus rate or AV conduction.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Patients with obstructive (≥50% stenosis) left main (LM) coronary artery disease (CAD) are at high risk for adverse events; prior studies have also documented worse outcomes among women than men with severe multivessel/LM CAD. However, the prognostic significance of nonobstructive (1%-49% stenosis) LM CAD, including sex-specific differences, has not been previously examined. METHODS AND RESULTS In the long-term CONFIRM (Coronary CT Angiography Evaluation For Clinical Outcomes: An International Multicenter) registry, patients underwent elective coronary computed tomographic angiography for suspected CAD and were followed for 5 years. After excluding those with obstructive LM CAD, 5166 patients were categorized as having normal LM or nonobstructive LM (18% of cohort). Cumulative 5-year incidence of death, myocardial infarction, or revascularization was higher among patients with nonobstructive LM than normal LM in both women and men: women (34.3% versus 15.4%; P<0.0001); men (24.6% versus 18.2%; P<0.0001). A significant interaction existed between sex and LM status for the composite outcome (P=0.001). In multivariable Cox regression, the presence of nonobstructive LM plaque increased the risk for the composite outcome in women (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.48; P=0.005) but not in men (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.98, P=0.806). In subgroup analysis, women with nonobstructive LM CAD had a nearly 80% higher risk for events than men with nonobstructive LM CAD (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.78; P=0.017); sex-specific interactions were not observed across other patterns (eg, location or extent) of nonobstructive plaque. CONCLUSION Nonobstructive LM CAD was frequently detected on coronary computed tomographic angiography and strongly associated with adverse events among women. Recognizing the sex-specific prognostic significance of nonobstructive LM plaque may augment risk stratification efforts.},

abstract = {Most deaths in the first 30 days after cardiac transplantation are due to failure of the donor heart, often with the clinical picture of right ventricular failure. Indeed, there is a significant reduction in contractility of the human donor heart and loss of contractile reserve before and soon after transplantation. This myocardial insult appears in association with brain death in the donor and follows a "catecholamine storm" associated with a rapidly rising intracranial pressure. Microscopy of the myocardium in organ donors shows a picture typical of catecholamine-induced injury and similar to changes found in endomyocardial specimens of stress cardiomyopathy (catecholamineinduced cardiomyopathy, or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy). There are 3 common features between stress cardiomyopathy and the heart of a brain-dead donor: exposure of the heart to unusually high catecholamine levels, ventricular dysfunction, and prompt recovery. Stress cardiomyopathy is a temporary myocardial dysfunction that has been described after sub-arachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic head injury, pheochromocytoma, acute emotional distress, exogenous administration of catecholamines, and non-related surgery. Given the common features of this catecholamine-mediated myocardial insult, we ask if brain-dead donor heart dysfunction is an extreme variant of stress cardiomyopathy? And, if so is it, like stress cardiomyopathy, reversible? Can we therefore expect recovery of the dysfunctional donor heart over time, thereby permitting increased use of hearts offered for transplantation? {\textcopyright} 2010 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation All rights reserved.},

abstract = {There exists a robust day/night pattern in the incidence of adverse cardiac events with a peak at approximately 10 a.m. This peak traditionally has been attributed to day/night patterns in behaviors affecting cardiac function in vulnerable individuals. However, influences from the endogenous circadian pacemaker independent from behaviors may also affect cardiac control. Heartbeat dynamics under healthy conditions exhibit robust complex fluctuations characterized by self-similar temporal structures, which break down under pathologic conditions. We hypothesize that these dynamical features of the healthy human heartbeat have an endogenous circadian rhythm that brings the features closer to those observed under pathologic conditions at the endogenous circadian phase corresponding to approximately 10 a.m. We investigate heartbeat dynamics in healthy subjects recorded throughout a 10-day protocol wherein the sleep/wake and behavior cycles are desynchronized from the endogenous circadian cycle, enabling assessment of circadian factors while controlling for behavior-related factors. We demonstrate that the scaling exponent characterizing temporal correlations in heartbeat dynamics does exhibit a significant circadian rhythm (with a sharp peak at the circadian phase corresponding to approximately 10 a.m.), which is independent from scheduled behaviors and mean heart rate. Cardiac dynamics under pathologic conditions such as congestive heart failure also are associated with a larger value of the scaling exponent of the interbeat interval. Thus, the sharp peak in the scaling exponent at the circadian phase coinciding with the period of highest cardiac vulnerability observed in epidemiological studies suggests that endogenous circadian-mediated influences on cardiac control may be involved in the day/night pattern of adverse cardiac events in vulnerable individuals.},

abstract = {Objective Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and despite important advances in our understanding of this disorder, the underlying mechanisms remain under investigation. Recently, increased attention has been placed on the role of behavioral factors such as emotional stress on CAD risk. Brain areas involved in memory and the stress response, including medial prefrontal cortex, insula, and parietal cortex, also have outputs to the peripheral cardiovascular system. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of mental stress on brain and cardiac function in patients with CAD. Methods CAD patients (N = 170) underwent cardiac imaging with [Tc-99m] sestamibi single-photon emission tomography at rest and during a public speaking mental stress task. On another day, they underwent imaging of the brain with [O-15] water positron emission tomography (PET) during mental stress (arithmetic and public speaking) and control conditions. Results Patients with mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia showed increased activation with stress in anterior cingulate, inferior frontal gyrus, and parietal cortex (p <.005). This was seen with both arithmetic stress and public speaking stress. Arithmetic stress was additionally associated with left insula activation, and public speaking with right pre/postcentral gyrus and middle temporal gyrus activation (p <.005). Conclusions These findings suggest that mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is associated with activation in brain areas involved in the stress response and autonomic regulation of the cardiovascular system. Altered brain reactivity to stress could possibly represent a mechanism through which stress leads to increased risk of CAD-related morbidity and mortality.},

abstract = {Efferent sympathetic activities were simultaneously recorded from two thoracic cardiac nerves in 33 chloralose-anesthetized dogs. Efferent innervation patterns were determined by electrical stimulation prior to recording in each animal. One of the nerves selected for recording was shown to innervate the proposed ischemic region, whereas the other nerve was selected because it was shown to innervate nonischemic regions. Left ventricular ischemia was produced by occlusion of a branch of either the left anterior descending (LAD) or left circumflex (LCX) coronary arteries. Heart rate was paced. Cardiac postganglionic sympathetic efferent activities were recorded during a 30-min coronary occlusion in 22 animals. Thirty minutes after LAD occlusion (n = 10), postganglionic sympathetic activity to ischemic myocardium was decreased (84 +/- 5% of control; P less than 0.05) while activity to nonischemic myocardium was unchanged. Thirty minutes after LCX occlusion (n = 12), postganglionic sympathetic activity to ischemic myocardium was also decreased (87 +/- 3% of control; P less than 0.01); however, sympathetic activity to nonischemic myocardium was increased (159 +/- 10% of control; P less than 0.001). Thus, in the anesthetized canine, regional left ventricular ischemia elicits differential sympathetic neural responses that are dependent on the location of the ischemic myocardium as well as the efferent destinations of the nerves. Changes in cardiac postganglionic sympathetic efferent activities are characterized by decreased activity to ischemic regions, with either no change or increased activity to nonischemic regions.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to develop a technique to selectively increase the sympathetic tone to the heart by cardiac sympathetic nerve stimulation (SNS). BACKGROUND: Access to the cardiac sympathetic neurons may allow modulating the adrenergic tone of the heart while avoiding systemic side effects. METHODS: Cardiac sympathetic nerves course within neural sleeves along the subclavian artery. Because of this proximity, transvascular SNS was attempted with electrode catheters inside the subclavian artery in 16 pigs. RESULTS: Right/left (R-/L-) SNS (20 Hz) during ventricular pacing at 200/min evoked a >100% increase of left ventricular systolic pressure (baseline: 51 ± 1 mm Hg; L-SNS: 118 ± 26 mm Hg; R-SNS: 116 ± 33 mm Hg; p < 0.001) while systemic vascular resistance remained unchanged. There was a sigmoid dose-response curve with rapid on- and offset of the effect during SNS initiation/cessation. Positive inotropic effects persisted for 12 h of continued SNS (n = 4). Besides positive dromotropic effects, L-SNS/R-SNS yielded a 41% and 77% sinus rate increase, respectively.

abstract = {NEW FINDINGS: What is the topic of this review? This symposium report discusses the evidence for release of cardiac sympathetic cotransmitters in addition to noradrenaline. What advances does it highlight? It highlights the potential role of neuropeptide Y in reducing vagal neurotransmission and directly influencing ventricular myocyte excitability in the presence of $\beta$-receptor blockade. Acute myocardial infarction and congestive cardiac failure are characterized by high levels of cardiac sympathetic drive. In these conditions, sympathetic neurotransmitters such as neuropeptide Y (NPY) can be released in addition to noradrenaline, and plasma levels correlate with infarct size and mortality. Even in the presence of $\beta$-blockers, NPY is able to bind to its own receptors located on cholinergic ganglia and ventricular myocytes. In this symposium report, I review the evidence that NPY can inhibit acetylcholine release during vagus nerve stimulation and limit the subsequent bradycardia. I also present preliminary, as yet unpublished data, demonstrating that NPY may be pro-arrhythmic by directly influencing ventricular electrophysiology. Targeting NPY receptors pharmacologically may therefore be a useful therapeutic strategy both to reduce heart rate and to prevent arrhythmias in the setting of myocardial infarction and chronic heart failure. Such medications would be expected to act synergistically with $\beta$-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and implantable cardiac devices, such as defibrillators and vagus nerve stimulators.},

Some pharmacological data, however, are inconsistent with these conclusions. We have examined the cardiodynamic effects of discrete injections of a ganglionic blocking drug into two fat pads on the surface of the cat heart. These fat pads were shown to contain ganglion cells histologically. It was observed that vagal effects upon cardiac rate are selectively mediated by neurons located in ganglia overlying the right pulmonary veins at the junction of the right atrium and superior vena cava. On the other hand, vagal effects upon AV conduction were selectively mediated by neurons located in a fat pad at the junction of the inferior vena cava and the inferior left atrium. These pharmacological data support the concept that specific intracardiac ganglia are capable of selective control of SA rate and AV conduction. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

The mean heart rate for depressed patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) was significantly higher than for nondepressed CAD patients, independent of the patient's age, smoking status, and beta blocker therapy. Heart rate variability was lower in depressed patients but did not achieve significance. With the exception of smoking, which was more common in depressed patients, there were no significant differences between the depressed and nondepressed patients on any other medical or demographic variable assessed.

abstract = {Many therapeutic interventions in disease states of heightened cardiac sympathetic activity are targeted to the myocytes. However, emerging clinical data highlights a dominant role in disease progression by the neurons themselves. Here we describe a novel experimental model of the peripheral neuro-cardiac axis to study the neuron's ability to drive a myocyte cAMP phenotype. We employed a co-culture of neonatal ventricular myocytes and sympathetic stellate neurons from normal (WKY) and pro-hypertensive (SHR) rats that are sympathetically hyper-responsive and measured nicotine evoked cAMP responses in the myocytes using a fourth generation FRET cAMP sensor. We demonstrated the dominant role of neurons in driving the myocyte {\ss}-adrenergic phenotype, where SHR cultures elicited heightened myocyte cAMP responses during neural activation. Moreover, cross-culturing healthy neurons onto diseased myocytes rescued the diseased cAMP response of the myocyte. Conversely, healthy myocytes developed a diseased cAMP response if diseased neurons were introduced. Our results provide evidence for a dominant role played by the neuron in driving the adrenergic phenotype seen in cardiovascular disease. We also highlight the potential of using healthy neurons to turn down the gain of neurotransmission, akin to a smart pre-synaptic {\ss}-blocker.},

abstract = {KEY POINTS: The parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) is critical for adaptation to environment demands. Alzheimer's disease (AD), via frontal compensatory processes, may affect PNS regulation, thereby compromising older adults' capacity for adaptation, and increasing morbidity and mortality risk. Here we found that AD-associated neurodegeneration accompanied an overactive anterior cingulate cortex, which in turn resulted in a high level of PNS activity at rest, as well as strong PNS activity withdrawal in response to the mental effort. This discovery provides the first line of evidence to suggest that AD-associated neurodegeneration links to altered PNS regulation during mental effort in older adults, and that the compensatory processes accompanying frontal hyperactivation appear to be responsible for these alterations. ABSTRACT: The parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) is critical for adaptation to environment demands. PNS can reflect an individual's regulatory capacity of frontal brain regions and has been linked to cognitive capacity. Yet, the relationship of PNS function to cognitive decline and abnormal frontal function that characterize preclinical progression toward Alzheimer's disease (AD) is unclear. Here, we aimed to elucidate the relationship between PNS function and AD-associated neurodegeneration by testing two competing hypotheses involving frontal regions' activity (neurodegeneration vs. compensation). In 38 older human adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) or normative cognition, we measured AD-associated neurodegeneration (AD signature cortical thickness; ADSCT), resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging of frontal regions' spontaneous activation, and an electrocardiography measure of PNS (high frequency heart rate variability; HF-HRV). HF-HRV was assessed at rest and during a cognitive task protocol designed to capture HF-HRV reactivity. Higher HF-HRV at rest was significantly related to both more severe AD-associated neurodegeneration (lower ADSCT scores) and worse cognitive ability. Cognitive impairments were also related to greater suppression of HF-HRV reactivity. High activities of the anterior cingulate cortex significantly mediated relationships between ADSCT and both HF-HRV at rest and HF-HRV reactivity. Notably, these relationships were not affected by the clinical phenotype. We show that AD-associated neurodegeneration is associated with altered PNS regulation and that compensatory processes linked to frontal overactivation might be responsible for those alterations. This finding provides the first line of evidence in a new framework for understanding how early-stage AD-associated neurodegeneration affects autonomic regulation.},

abstract = {Coronary artery events requiring intervention are associated with depressed cardiac autonomic function. Whether a 6-week cardiac rehabilitation (CR) differs in effectiveness in improving exercise capacity (6MWT), cardiorespiratory function (peakVO2), and autonomic function (HRV) following either cardiac bypass surgery (CABG) or percutaneous coronary revascularization (PCI) is unknown. The current study therefore compared the change in 6MWT and peak VO2 to HRV variables following a 6-week CR program and with patients having either PCI or CABG. Thirty-eight patients, (PCI, n = 22 and CABG, n = 16) participated in the CR program and results for pre and post 6 min walk test (6MWT), peakVO2, and heart rate variability (HRV) were obtained. Our study has shown that a 6 weeks program following either PCI or CABG improves function. However, the effect on post-CABG differs to that of post-PCI patients. The change in distance walked (6MWT, metres) was higher in the CABG ($\Delta$6MWT: 61, p < 0.001) compared to the PCI group ($\Delta$6MWT: 41, p < 0.001). Maximum exercise capacity (peak VO2, ml/kg.min) also changed significantly with a greater change in the CABG group ($\Delta$PCI: 0.7, p < 0.001; $\Delta$CABG: 1.0, p < 0.001) but did not reach normal population values. Although an improvement in HRV parameters was noted for the PCI group, a statistically significant improvement in HRV was observed only in the CABG group for the following; SDNN (ms) (baseline vs. post-rehabilitation (median ± IQR): 31.2 ± 25.6 vs. 51.8 ± 23.1, p < 0.01), RMSSD (19.32 ± 19.9 vs. 42.1 ± 34.2, p < 0.01); LF (ms(2)) (191 ± 216 vs. 631 ± 693, p < 0.01) and HF (107 ± 201 vs. 449 ± 795.0, p < 0.05). A significant interaction in the PCI group but not in the CABG group was observed using correlation analysis between the 6MWT and peak VO2 with HRV parameters indicating that being healthier that is, a better 6MWT and peak VO2 led to better HRV results but no significant effect of CR in the PCI group. When the results were investigated for baseline 6MWT and peak VO2 effect using a covariate analysis, a significant influence of CR on HRV parameters was retained in the CABG group (p = 0.0072). Our study indicates that a 6-weeks CR program benefits both patient groups in terms of exercise capacity, cardiorespiratory function and autonomic nervous system modulation of heart rate, with CABG patients showing the most improvement. HRV can be a useful additional variable to gauge cardiac function following CR.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Major depressive disorder (MDD) occurs in 15% to 23% of patients with acute coronary syndromes and constitutes an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality. However, no published evidence exists that antidepressant drugs are safe or efficacious in patients with unstable ischemic heart disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of sertraline treatment of MDD in patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina and free of other life-threatening medical conditions. DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 40 outpatient cardiology centers and psychiatry clinics in the United States, Europe, Canada, and Australia. Enrollment began in April 1997 and follow-up ended in April 2001. PATIENTS: A total of 369 patients with MDD (64% male; mean age, 57.1 years; mean 17-item Hamilton Depression [HAM-D] score, 19.6; MI, 74%; unstable angina, 26%). INTERVENTION: After a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in, patients were randomly assigned to receive sertraline in flexible dosages of 50 to 200 mg/d (n = 186) or placebo (n = 183) for 24 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary (safety) outcome measure was change from baseline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); secondary measures included surrogate cardiac measures and cardiovascular adverse events, as well as scores on the HAM-D scale and Clinical Global Impression Improvement scale (CGI-I) in the total randomized sample, in a group with any prior history of MDD, and in a more severe MDD subgroup defined a priori by a HAM-D score of at least 18 and history of 2 or more prior episodes of MDD. RESULTS: Sertraline had no significant effect on mean (SD) LVEF (sertraline: baseline, 54% [10%]; week 16, 54% [11%]; placebo: baseline, 52% [13%]; week 16, 53% [13%]), treatment-emergent increase in ventricular premature complex (VPC) runs (sertraline: 13.1%; placebo: 12.9%), QTc interval greater than 450 milliseconds at end point (sertraline: 12%; placebo: 13%), or other cardiac measures. All comparisons were statistically nonsignificant (P> or = .05). The incidence of severe cardiovascular adverse events was 14.5% with sertraline and 22.4% with placebo. In the total randomized sample, the CGI-I (P =.049), but not the HAM-D (P =.14), favored sertraline. The CGI-I responder rates for sertraline were significantly higher than for placebo in the total sample (67% vs 53%; P =.01), in the group with at least 1 prior episode {\ldots}},

abstract = {In humans, the parasympathetic nervous system predominates over the sympathetic nervous system in control of heart rate, but little is known about the relative influences of cholinergic and adrenergic tone on the electrophysiological properties of the ventricle and atrioventricular (AV) node. Thirteen subjects were studied using standard electrophysiological testing techniques in the control state and after propranolol (0.15 mg/kg, iv) plus atropine (0.03 mg/kg, iv) to assess the effect of autonomic blockade on ventricular and AV nodal refractoriness and AV nodal conduction. Eight subjects received propranolol first (group A) and five were given atropine first (group B). For groups A and B, the spontaneous sinus cycle length significantly decreased from control after administration or propranolol and atropine [813 ± 107 (SD) to 613 ± 57 msec and 842 ± 188 to 637 ± 115 msec, respectively] . Ventricular effective (ERP) and functional (FRP) refractory periods insignificantly increased from control after propranolol was given (group A); however, both ventricular ERP and FRP significantly shortened to less than control values after atropine was added (238 ± 23 to 218 ± 19 msec and 261 ± 22 to 243 ± 17 msec, respectively). Similar results for ventricular refractoriness occurred after administration of atropine and propranolol in group B subjects. The shortest atrial pacing cycle length sustaining 1:1 AV nodal conduction after administration of propranolol and atropine did not significantly change from control values (386 ± 109 to 372 ± 74 msec). These data suggest that (1) resting vagal tone exerts a significant effect on human ventricular refractoriness and the effect can occur in the presence of $\beta$-adrenergic blockade, and (2) in contrast to the markedly predominant effect of the parasympathetic nervous system on sinus nodal automaticity, vagal and adrenergic tone exert a balanced effect on resting AV nodal conduction.},

abstract = {Worldwide, sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a major problem. It is most frequently caused by ventricular tachyarrhythmias: Monomorphic and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), torsade de pointes (TdP), and ventricular fibrillation (VF). Beta blockade, ACE inhibition, coronary reperfusion and other treatments have reduced the incidence of VT but pulseless electrical activity (PEA) is increasingly seen, particularly in patients with advanced chronic heart disease. From existing data, bradyarrhythmia in the form of asystole (usually complete heart block without escape rhythm) causes only a minor proportion (10-15%) of SCD. In patients aged 50 years and more, coronary artery disease plays a dominant role causing more than 75% of SCD cases, either by acute ischemia and ventricular fibrillation or by chronic scar formation and reentrant VT. In younger patients, SCD may occur in patients with structurally normal hearts. A number of arrhythmogenic disorders with an increased risk of SCD have been detected and better understood recently, such as long and short QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and the early repolarization syndrome. Most importantly, ECG signs and clinical features indicating high risk for SCD have been identified. Knowledge of the exact electrophysiologic mechanisms of ventricular tachyarrhythmias at the cellular level has been improved and mechanisms such as phase 2 reentry and reflection proposed to better understand why and how SCD occurs. {\textcopyright} 2014, Cardiological Society of India.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim was to determine the capacity of nodose ganglion afferent neurones with epicardial sensory endings to respond to mechanical and chemical stimuli, in particular to purinergic compounds.\n\nMETHODS: Alterations in spontaneous activity generated by epicardial afferent neurones in nodose ganglia in situ of 17 anaesthetised dogs were identified using extracellular recording techniques when mechanical and chemical stimuli were applied to their receptor fields, as well as during brief periods of coronary artery occlusion.\n\nRESULTS: 92 cardiac afferent neurones were identified. Localised epicardial distortion modified the activity generated by 34 neurones [0.19(SEM 0.02) to 1.2(0.4) impulses.s-1]. Application of bradykinin, substance P, N6-cyclopentyladenosine or beta, gamma-methylene adenosine 5'-triphosphate to localised epicardial fields altered the activity of 69 neurones. Thus the majority of identified epicardial neurones responded to chemical stimuli alone (63%) as opposed to mechanical stimuli alone (25%), 12% responding to both types of stimuli. Activity was enhanced overall by chemical stimuli from a mean range of 0.1-0.4 to 11.6-13.2 impulses.s-1. Following termination of short lasting chemical as opposed to mechanical stimuli, activity remained increased for up to 45 min. Activity generated by 16 chemosensitive neurones was modified by brief periods of coronary artery occlusion [0.26(0.12)-1.66(0.61) impulses.s-1]; activity increasing further [2.51(0.47) impulses.s-1] during reperfusion periods.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: (1) Chemical stimuli induce an order magnitude greater enhancement of activity generated by nodose ganglion cardiac afferent neurones than do mechanical stimuli, such enhancement persisting long after removal of chemical as opposed to mechanical stimuli. Thus qualitative and quantitative differences exists between central neuronal inputs derived from nodose ganglion epicardial afferent neurones sensitive to chemical as opposed to mechanical stimuli. (2) Adenosine and ATP can activate nodose ganglion cardiac afferent neurones.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV), the beat-to-beat variation in either heart rate or the duration of the R-R interval, has become a popular clinical and investigational tool (Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Billman, 2011). Indeed, the term “heart rate variability” yields nearly 18,000 “hits” when placed in the pubmed search engine. These temporal fluctuations in heart rate exhibit a marked synchrony with respiration (increasing during inspiration and decreasing during expiration—the so called respiratory sinus arrhythmia) and are widely believed to reflect changes in cardiac autonomic regulation (Billman, 2011). Although the exact contributions of the parasympathetic and the sympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system to this variability are controversial and remain the subject of active investigation and debate, a number of time and frequency domain techniques have been developed to provide insight into cardiac autonomic regulation in both health and disease (Billman, 2011). It is the purpose of this book to provide a comprehensive assessment of the strengths and limitations of HRV techniques. Particular emphasis will be placed on the application of HRV techniques in the clinic and on the interaction between prevailing heart rate and HRV. This book contains both state-of-the art review and original research articles that have been grouped into two main sections: Methodological Considerations and Clinical Application. A brief summary of the chapters contained in each section follows below.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Clinical depression is a risk factor for cardiac mortality in patients with coronary heart disease. High QT interval variability is a risk factor for arrhythmic events, including sudden cardiac death. The purpose of this study was to determine whether depression is associated with increased QT variability in patients recovering from myocardial infarction. METHODS: Twenty patients with major depression recovering from a recent myocardial infarction were matched with 20 nondepressed post-myocardial infarction patients on age and sex, and all underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring. RESULTS: There were no differences between groups on average heart rate, heart rate variability, or other electrocardiographic measures. However, the QT interval showed significantly greater variability in the depressed than in the nondepressed group, especially at midnight and at 6:00 AM. CONCLUSIONS: Depressed post-myocardial infarction patients may be at greater risk for sudden cardiac death as a result of abnormalities in ventricular repolarization. More work is needed to determine the clinical and prognostic significance of QT variability in these patients.},

abstract = {A broad spectrum of research, spanning epidemiological studies, clinical research, preclinical investigations and animal models, has pointed to a link between psychological factors and cardiovascular dysfunctional states. Acute and chronic life stressors, psychological alterations such as anxiety and depression, personality traits such as anger and hostility, reactive behavioral coping strategies, as well as the absence of social support have all been shown to interfere with and modulate the onset and progression of cardiovascular alterations. These psychological elements, in many instances, appear to be independent risk factors of disease, as important as traditional ones such as cholesterol levels, waist fat, body mass index and poor physical activity. Recently developed research approaches have shed light on the brain substrates, genetic and epigenetic factors, as well as cellular/molecular mechanisms that underlie the tight and complex relationship between stress, behavior and the cardiovascular system. However, despite a growing number of empirical investigations and accumulating clinical evidence, still several issues remain to be clarified about the mechanisms linking stressful events, psychological traits, behavioral coping and cardiovascular risk profiles. This special issue is a collection of 19 selected review papers that present the newest scientific evidence in the multidisciplinary arena intersecting stress, behavior and the cardiovascular system. It gathers the contribution of leading scientists from a variety of disciplines (neuroscience, physiology, cardiology, pharmacology, psychology, epidemiology) who share a common interest in the complex interactions between the mind and the heart. A deeper understanding of such complex relationship cannot be achieved without a multipronged effort that includes basic science, preclinical research on animal models and human clinical and nonclinical studies.

abstract = {Diminished baroreflex sensitivity in the morning negatively influences morning coronary blood flow and blood pressure control in hypertensive patients. Our aim was to determine the contribution of the mechanical and neural components of the cardiac baroreflex to diurnal variation in blood pressure control. In 12 healthy participants, we used the modified Oxford method to quantify baroreflex sensitivity for rising (G(up)) and falling (G(down)) pressures in the morning (7:00 am) and afternoon (4:00 pm). Beat-to-beat blood pressure, R-R intervals, and carotid artery diameter measurements were recorded. Integrated sensitivity was determined by plotting R-R intervals against systolic blood pressure. The mechanical component was carotid artery diameter plotted against systolic blood pressure, and the neural component was R-R intervals plotted against carotid artery diameter. Linear mixed models were used to compare the integrated, mechanical, and neural sensitivities between morning and afternoon. We found significant diurnal variation in integrated sensitivity, with an attenuated response in the morning (G(up)=13.0±0.6; G(down)=6.3±0.4 ms/mm Hg) when compared with the afternoon (G(up)=15.1±0.6; G(down)=12.6±0.4 ms/mm Hg). For rising pressures, the diminished integrated sensitivity in the morning was caused by a reduction in mechanical sensitivity, whereas for falling pressures it was caused by a reduction in neural sensitivity. Our findings explicate the mechanisms underlying diurnal variation in baroreflex function. Pharmacological and lifestyle interventions targeted specifically at the diminished component of the cardiac baroreflex in the morning may lead to better management of hypertension.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with myocardial infarction (MI) with a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) have a poor prognosis, but the role of emotional stress in prognosis is not known. We hypothesized that emotional stress in these patients (1) is unrelated to the severity of cardiac disorder, (2) predicts cardiac events, and (3) is a function of basic personality traits. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients with MI (age, 41 to 69 years) with an LVEF of < or =50% underwent psychological assessment at baseline. Patients and their families were contacted after 6 to 10 years (mean, 7.9 years); cardiac events were defined as cardiac death or nonfatal MI. Emotional distress was unrelated to the severity of cardiac disorder. At follow-up, 21 patients had experienced a cardiac event (13 fatal events). These events were related to LVEF of < or =30%, poor exercise tolerance, previous MI, anxiety, anger, and depression (all P< or =.02). Patients with a distressed personality (type D; ie, the tendency to suppress negative emotions) were more likely to experience an event over time compared with non-type D patients (P=.00005). Cox proportional hazards analysis yielded LVEF of < or =30% (relative risk, 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 7.7; P=.02) and type D (relative risk, 4.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.9 to 11.8; P=.001) as independent predictors. Anxiety, anger, and depression did not add to the predictive power of type D; these negative emotions were highly correlated and reflected the personality domain of negative affectivity. CONCLUSIONS: Personality influences the clinical course of patients with a decreased LVEF. Emotional distress in these patients is unrelated to disease severity but reflects individual differences in personality. Clinical trials should take a broad view of the target of intervention; assessment of LVEF and personality may identify patients at risk.},

In 20 dogs with a healed myocardial infarction and in 7 healthy dogs a bipolar electrode was chronically implanted around the right cervical vagus. Vagal stimulation (3 ms; 2.1 +/- 0.7 mA; 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 Hz) was performed while dogs stood on the treadmill (heart rate 120 +/- 25 beats/min) and while they exercised (201 +/- 17 beats/min). Gradual increases of the frequency of vagal stimulation gradually enhanced the inhibitory effect on heart rate both before and during exercise. During exercise, heart rate reduction was significantly greater than that produced at rest at any frequency of stimulation (P less than 0.001). This difference widened as the frequency of stimulation increased and the interaction with or without the presence of exercise was significant (P less than 0.02). Vagal stimulation produced similar effects in the seven dogs without myocardial infarction. These data demonstrate that the vagal-sympathetic "accentuated antagonism" described in anesthetized animals is also present in conscious dogs.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Anatomical Society. The rabbit is widely used in experimental cardiac physiology, but the neuroanatomy of the rabbit heart remains insufficiently examined. This study aimed to ascertain the architecture of the intrinsic nerve plexus in the walls and septum of rabbit cardiac ventricles. In 51 rabbit hearts, a combined approach involving: (i) histochemical acetylcholinesterase staining of intrinsic neural structures in total cardiac ventricles; (ii) immunofluorescent labelling of intrinsic nerves, nerve fibres (NFs) and neuronal somata (NS); and (iii) transmission electron microscopy of intrinsic ventricular nerves and NFs was used. Mediastinal nerves access the ventral and lateral surfaces of both ventricles at a restricted site between the root of the ascending aorta and the pulmonary trunk. The dorsal surface of both ventricles is supplied by several epicardial nerves extending from the left dorsal ganglionated nerve subplexus on the dorsal left atrium. Ventral accessing nerves are thicker and more numerous than dorsal nerves. Intrinsic ventricular NS are rare on the conus arteriosus and the root of the pulmonary trunk. The number of ventricular NS ranged from 11 to 220 per heart. Four chemical phenotypes of NS within ventricular ganglia were identified, i.e. ganglionic cells positive for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), and biphenotypic, i.e. positive for both ChAT/nNOS and for ChAT/tyrosine hydroxylase. Clusters of small intensely fluorescent cells are distributed within or close to ganglia on the root of the pulmonary trunk, but not on the conus arteriosus. The largest and most numerous intrinsic nerves proceed within the epicardium. Scarce nerves were found near myocardial blood vessels, but the myocardium contained only a scarce meshwork of NFs. In the endocardium, large numbers of thin nerves and NFs proceed along the bundle of His and both its branches up to the apex of the ventricles. The endocardial meshwork of fine NFs was approximately eight times denser than the myocardial meshwork. Adrenergic NFs predominate considerably in all layers of the ventricular walls and septum, whereas NFs of other neurochemical phenotypes were in the minority and their amount differed between the epicardium, myocardium and endocardium. The densities of NFs positive for nNOS and ChAT were similar in the epicardium and endocardium, but NFs positive for nNOS in the myocardium were eight times more abundant than NFs positive for ChAT. Potentially sensory NFs positive for both calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P were sparse in the myocardial layer, but numerous in epicardial nerves and particularly abundant within the endocardium. Electron microscopic observations demonstrate that intrinsic ventricular nerves have a distinctive morphology, which may be attributed to remodelling of the peripheral nerves after their access into the ventricular wall. In conclusion, the rabbit ventricles display complex structural organization of intrinsic ventricular nerves, NFs and ganglionic cells. The results provide a basic anatomical background for further functional analysis of the intrinsic nervous system in the cardiac ventricles.},

A decrease in ultra- low frequency power (< 0.0033 Hz) is known to be associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular mortality in humans. Twenty-four-hour ECG was recorded in 29 patients with panic disorder and 23 normal controls using Holter records. Data for 20 h and also 20 000 s of awake and 20 000 s of sleep periods were analyzed using spectral analysis to quantify absolute and relative heart-period variability in ultra low (ULF: < 0.0033 Hz), very low (VLF: 0.0033-0.04 Hz), low (LF: 0.04-0.15 Hz) and high (HF: 0.15-0.5 Hz) frequency bands. The patients with panic disorder had significantly lower total and absolute ULF power, which was more pronounced during sleep. The patients also had significantly lower relative ULF power and significantly higher relative LF power during sleep. There was a significant increase of relative LF power from awake to sleep period only in the patient group. The decrease in total and ULF power may increase the risk of mortality and sudden arrhythmic death in patients with panic disorder if they experience a cardiac event. The higher relative LF power during sleep also suggests a possible higher sympathetic drive in the patients during sleep.},

abstract = {Power spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) has been used to indicate cardiac autonomic function. High-frequency power relates to respiratory sinus arrhythmia and therefore to parasympathetic cardiovagal tone; however, the relationship of low-frequency (LF) power to cardiac sympathetic innervation and function has been controversial. Alternatively, LF power might reflect baro reflexive modulation of autonomic outflows. We studied normal volunteers and chronic autonomic failure syndrome patients with and without loss of cardiac noradrenergic nerves to examine the relationships of LF power with cardiac sympathetic innervation and baroreflex function. We compared LF power of HRV in patients with cardiac sympathetic denervation, as indicated by low myocardial concentrations of 6-[F]fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity or low rates of norepinephrine entry into coronary sinus plasma (cardiac norepinephrine spillover) to values in patients with intact innervation, at baseline, during infusion of yohimbine, which increases exocytotic norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerves, or during infusion of tyramine, which increases non-exocytotic release. Baroreflex-cardiovagal slope (BRS) was calculated from the cardiac interbeat interval and systolic pressure during the Valsalva maneuver. LF power was unrelated to myocardial 6-[F]fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity or cardiac norepinephrine spillover. In contrast, the log of LF power correlated positively with the log of BRS (r = 0.72, < 0.0001). Patients with a low BRS (‚{\^{a}}{\S}3 msec/mm Hg) had low LF power, regardless of cardiac innervation. Tyramine and yohimbine increased LF power in subjects with normal BRS but not in those with low BRS. BRS at baseline predicted LF responses to tyramine and yohimbine. LF power reflects baroreflex function, not cardiac sympathetic innervation.},

abstract = {Patients with cardiovascular disease show autonomic dysfunction, including sympathetic activation and vagal withdrawal, which leads to fatal events. This review aims to place sympathovagal balance as an essential element to be considered in management for cardiovascular disease patients who benefit from a cardiac rehabilitation program. Many studies showed that exercise training, as non-pharmacologic treatment, plays an important role in enhancing sympathovagal balance and could normalize levels of markers of sympathetic flow measured by microneurography, heart rate variability or plasma catecholamine levels. This alteration positively affects prognosis with cardiovascular disease. In general, cardiac rehabilitation programs include moderate-intensity and continuous aerobic exercise. Other forms of activities such as high-intensity interval training, breathing exercises, relaxation and transcutaneous electrical stimulation can improve sympathovagal balance and should be implemented in cardiac rehabilitation programs. Currently, the exercise training programs in cardiac rehabilitation are individualized to optimize health outcomes. The sports science concept of the heart rate variability (HRV)-vagal index used to manage exercise sessions (for a goal of performance) could be implemented in cardiac rehabilitation to improve cardiovascular fitness and autonomic nervous system function.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Left ventricular (LV) diameter is routinely measured on the echocardiogram but has not been jointly evaluated with the ejection fraction (EF) for risk stratification of sudden cardiac death (SCD). METHODS AND RESULTS: From a large ongoing community-based study of SCD (The Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study; population approximately 1 million), SCD cases were compared with geographic controls. LVEF and LV diameter, measured using the LV internal dimension in diastole (categorized as normal, mild, moderate, or severe dilatation using American Society of Echocardiography definitions) were assessed from echocardiograms prior but unrelated to the SCD event. Cases (n=418; 69.5+/-13.8 years), compared with controls (n=329; 67.7+/-11.9 years), more commonly had severe LV dysfunction (EF </=35%; 30.5% versus 18.8%; P<0.01) and larger LV diameter (52.2+/-10.5 mm versus 49.7+/-7.9 mm; P<0.01). Moderate or severe LV dilatation (16.3% versus 8.2%; P=0.001) and severe LV dilatation (8.1% versus 2.1%; P<0.001) were significantly more frequent in cases. In multivariable analysis, severe LV dilatation was an independent predictor of SCD (odds ratio 2.5 [95% CI 1.03 to 5.9]; P=0.04). In addition, subjects with both EF </=35% and severe LV dilatation had higher odds for SCD compared with those with low EF only (odds ratio 3.8 [95% CI 1.5 to 10.2] for both versus 1.7 [95% CI 1.2 to 2.5] for low EF only), suggesting that severe LV dilatation additively increased SCD risk.

abstract = {Background Heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of cardiac autonomic nervous system functioning, has emerged as a physiological indicator for emotional regulation and psychological well-being. HRV is understudied in the context of depression and anxiety in young people (10–24 years old). Main objectives: (1) describe the nature and breadth of reviewed studies; and (2) synthesize main findings in the context of clinical and non-clinical populations of young people with depression and/or anxiety. Methods The Arksey and O'Malley methodology was utilized for this scoping review. CINHAL, EMBASE, Medline, PsychInfo, Scopus, Web of Science, as well as grey literature, were searched. Two reviewers screened titles, abstracts and full papers for inclusion. A total of 20 citations were included in the final review (19 citations peer-reviewed journal articles, 1 journal abstract). Numerical and thematic analysis was used to summarize study findings. Results In clinical populations of either depression or anxiety, HRV was lower compared to controls. In non-clinical populations of either depression or anxiety, HRV was found to be lower in those who reported more depression or anxiety symptoms. Limitations The quality of the reviewed articles was not assessed which limits the ability to generate conclusions regarding study findings. Conclusion Changes in HRV were found across the spectrum of clinical and non-clinical populations of young people with depression or anxiety. Neurophysiological research on depression and anxiety in young people can act as a first step to understanding how physiological flexibility (i.e. HRV) is related to psychological flexibility (i.e. adaptive or maladaptive responses to life events).},

@article{Opthof1991,
abstract = {In 18 dogs on total cardiopulmonary bypass, the average interval between local activations during artificially induced ventricular fibrillation (VF interval) was measured from extracellular electrograms, simultaneously recorded from up to 32 ventricular sites. VF intervals were used as an index of local refractoriness, based on the assumption that during ventricular fibrillation, cells are reexcited as soon as they have recovered their excitability. In support of this, microelectrode recordings in two hearts during ventricular fibrillation did not show a diastolic interval between successive action potentials. Refractory periods determined at a basic cycle length of 300 msec with the extrastimulus method correlated well with VF intervals measured at the same sites. Thus, this technique allows assessment of spatial dispersion of refractoriness during brief interventions such as sympathetic stimulation. The responses to left, right, and combined stellate ganglion stimulation varied substantially among individual hearts. This was observed both in dogs with an intact (n = 12) and decentralized (n = 6) autonomic nervous system. Individual ventricular sites could show effects of both left and right stellate ganglion stimulation (42% of tested sites) or show effects of left-sided stimulation only (31%) or right-sided stimulation only (14%). In 13% of sites, no effects of stellate stimulation were observed. Apart from these regional effects, the responses could be qualitatively different; that is, within the same heart, the VF interval prolonged at one site but shortened at another in response to the same intervention, although shortening was the general effect and prolongation the exception. Whenever sites responded to stellate ganglion stimulation with a shortening of VF interval, this shortening was approximately 10% for left, right, or combined stimulation, whether the autonomic nervous system was intact or decentralized. In six of 12 hearts in the intact group, there was a distinct regional effect of left stellate ganglion stimulation; in the other six hearts, the effects were distributed homogeneously over the ventricles. In three hearts, the effect of left stellate ganglion stimulation was strongest in the posterior wall, and in the other three hearts, in the anterior wall. The effects of right stellate ganglion stimulation were restricted to the anterior or lateral part of the left ventricle. Dispersion of VF intervals increased after left and combined stellate ganglion stimulation in the intact group and after right stellate ganglion stimulation in the decentralized group, but not significantly in every heart. This points to a marked individual variation with regard to the effects of sympathetic stimulation on electrophysiological properties of the heart.},

Our goal was to investigate how false-positive g-SPECT perfusion abnormalities relate to cardiovascular risk factors and whether they provide any prognostic information.\n\nMETHODS: From 1999 to 2005, a group of 130 anginal patients with myocardial perfusion abnormalities at stress g-SPECT, with normal coronary angiography or less than 50% lumen reduction and with a left ventricular ejection fraction more than 0.45, was selected. The extent of myocardial perfusion abnormalities after stress was quantified using the summed difference score (SDS).\n\nRESULTS: Using a logistic regression model, it was found that cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, smoking habit, hypercholesterolemia and obesity) were closely related (r = 0.96) to the SDS. During a 44 +/- 7-month follow-up, six patients experienced nonfatal cardiac events. An SDS more than 7 (P < 0.0001) and diabetes mellitus (P < 0.0001) were the only independent predictors of event-free survival using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis.\n\nCONCLUSION: In patients with anginal-like chest pain and without significant coronary stenoses, stress-induced myocardial perfusion abnormalities at g-SPECT correlate with cardiovascular risk factors and are independent predictors of the few, minor adverse cardiac events during the follow-up.},

The effect of sympathetic stimulation on responses to programmed ventricular stimulation was studied in dogs without myocardial infarction (Group I: n = 5), with transmural anterior wall myocardial infarction (Group II: n = 6) and with nontransmural anterior wall myocardial infarction (Group III: n = 9). Ventricular effective refractory period during sympathetic stimulation decreased by 16 ± 18, 1 ± 2 and 12 ± 8 ms (mean ± SD) in viable muscle of the inferoapical left ventricle in Groups I, II and III, respectively, suggesting efferent sympathetic denervation by transmural myocardial infarction only. Sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation was induced more easily during sympathetic stimulation in six of the six dogs with transmural infarction, but in only two of the nine dogs with nontransmural infarction (p < 0.01). It is concluded that the partial sympathetic denervation produced by transmural myocardial Infarction enhances the ease of induction of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation during sympathetic stimulation. A similar mechanism may lead to increased risk for lethal arrhythmias during periods of high sympathetic tone in patients with transmural myocardial infarction. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {AIMS: The purpose of this study was to identify novel genetic variants influencing circulating asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) levels and to evaluate whether they have a prognostic value on cardiovascular mortality.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a genome-wide association study on the methylarginine traits and investigated the predictive value of the new discovered variants on mortality. Our meta-analyses replicated the previously known locus for ADMA levels in DDAH1 (rs997251; P = 1.4 × 10(-40)), identified two non-synomyous polymorphisms for SDMA levels in AGXT2 (rs37369; P = 1.4 × 10(-40) and rs16899974; P = 1.5 × 10(-38)) and one in SLC25A45 (rs34400381; P = 2.5 × 10(-10)). We also fine-mapped the AGXT2 locus for further independent association signals. The two non-synonymous AGXT2 variants independently associated with SDMA levels were also significantly related with short-term heart rate variability (HRV) indices in young adults. The major allele (C) of the novel non-synonymous rs16899974 (V498L) variant associated with decreased SDMA levels and an increase in the ratio between the low- and high-frequency spectral components of HRV (P = 0.00047). Furthermore, the SDMA decreasing allele (G) of the non-synomyous SLC25A45 (R285C) variant was associated with a lower resting mean heart rate during the HRV measurements (P = 0.0046), but not with the HRV indices. None of the studied genome-wide significant variants had any major effect on cardiovascular or total mortality in patients referred for coronary angiography.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: AGXT2 has an important role in SDMA metabolism in humans. AGXT2 may additionally have an unanticipated role in the autonomic nervous system regulation of cardiac function.},

MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for cohort studies that included participants with and without anxiety, including subjects with anxiety, worry, posttraumatic stress disorder, phobic anxiety, and panic disorder. We examined the association of anxiety with cardiovascular mortality, major cardiovascular events (defined as the composite of cardiovascular death, stroke, coronary heart disease, and heart failure), stroke, coronary heart disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. We identified 46 cohort studies containing 2,017,276 participants and 222,253 subjects with anxiety. Anxiety was associated with a significantly elevated risk of cardiovascular mortality (relative risk [RR] 1.41, CI 1.13 to 1.76), coronary heart disease (RR 1.41, CI 1.23 to 1.61), stroke (RR 1.71, CI 1.18 to 2.50), and heart failure (RR 1.35, CI 1.11 to 1.64). Anxiety was not significantly associated with major cardiovascular events or atrial fibrillation although CIs were wide. Phobic anxiety was associated with a higher risk of coronary heart disease than other anxiety disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorder was associated with a higher risk of stroke. Results were broadly consistent in sensitivity analyses. Anxiety disorders are associated with an elevated risk of a range of different cardiovascular events, including stroke, coronary heart disease, heart failure, and cardiovascular death. Whether these associations are causal is unclear.},

abstract = {Background: Symptomatic relief is the primary goal of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in stable angina and is commonly observed clinically. However, there is no evidence from blinded, placebo-controlled randomised trials to show its efficacy. Methods: ORBITA is a blinded, multicentre randomised trial of PCI versus a placebo procedure for angina relief that was done at five study sites in the UK. We enrolled patients with severe (≥70%) single-vessel stenoses. After enrolment, patients received 6 weeks of medication optimisation. Patients then had pre-randomisation assessments with cardiopulmonary exercise testing, symptom questionnaires, and dobutamine stress echocardiography. Patients were randomised 1:1 to undergo PCI or a placebo procedure by use of an automated online randomisation tool. After 6 weeks of follow-up, the assessments done before randomisation were repeated at the final assessment. The primary endpoint was difference in exercise time increment between groups. All analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle and the study population contained all participants who underwent randomisation. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02062593. Findings: ORBITA enrolled 230 patients with ischaemic symptoms. After the medication optimisation phase and between Jan 6, 2014, and Aug 11, 2017, 200 patients underwent randomisation, with 105 patients assigned PCI and 95 assigned the placebo procedure. Lesions had mean area stenosis of 84{\textperiodcentered}4% (SD 10{\textperiodcentered}2), fractional flow reserve of 0{\textperiodcentered}69 (0{\textperiodcentered}16), and instantaneous wave-free ratio of 0{\textperiodcentered}76 (0{\textperiodcentered}22). There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint of exercise time increment between groups (PCI minus placebo 16{\textperiodcentered}6 s, 95% CI −8{\textperiodcentered}9 to 42{\textperiodcentered}0, p=0{\textperiodcentered}200). There were no deaths. Serious adverse events included four pressure-wire related complications in the placebo group, which required PCI, and five major bleeding events, including two in the PCI group and three in the placebo group. Interpretation: In patients with medically treated angina and severe coronary stenosis, PCI did not increase exercise time by more than the effect of a placebo procedure. The efficacy of invasive procedures can be assessed with a placebo control, as is standard for pharmacotherapy.

abstract = {Background: The role of cardiac sympathetic nerves in regulating coronary blood flow is controversial. We sought to determine the degree to which cardiac efferent sympathetic signals modulate coronary blood flow. The heterogeneous sympathetic reinnervation in transplanted hearts provides a model for studying the vasomotor responses to adrenergic stimulation in reinnervated and denervated coronary territories of the same heart. Methods: We studied 14 cardiac-transplant recipients who had normal coronary arteries and no evidence of rejection and 8 normal subjects. We used positron-emission tomography with [11C]hydroxyephedrine, an analogue of norepinephrine, to delineate sympathetic innervation. Using [13N]ammonia, we measured myocardial blood flow at rest, during adenosine-induced hyperemia, and in response to sympathetic stimulation induced by cold pressor testing. Results: In the transplant recipients, the uptake of [11C]hydroxyephedrine was greater in the territory served by the left anterior descending artery (mean±SE, 0.15±0.01) than in those served by the right coronary artery (0.07±0.01, P<0.001) or the circumflex artery (0.09±0.01, P<0.001). The basal flow was similar in all three regions, as was the percent increase in flow during hyperemia. However, the increase in flow in response to cold pressor testing was higher in the territory of the left anterior descending artery (46±10 percent) than in those of the right coronary artery (16±6 percent, P=0.01) or the circumflex artery (23±6 percent, P=0.06), although the changes in hemodynamics and levels of circulating catecholamines were similar. No such regional differences were observed in the normal subjects. Conclusions: Increases in coronary blood flow in response to sympathetic stimulation correlated with the regional norepinephrine content in the cardiac sympathetic-nerve terminals. These findings suggest that cardiac adrenergic signals play an important part in regulating myocardial blood flow.},

abstract = {The population's aging underscores the need to understand the process and define the physiologic markers predictive of healthy longevity. The findings that aging is associated with a progressive decrease in heart rate variability (HRV), an index of autonomic function, suggests that longevity might depend on preservation of autonomic function. However, little is known about late life changes. We assessed the relation between autonomic function and longevity by a cross-sectional study of HRV of 344 healthy subjects, 10 to 99 years old. The HRV was determined from 24-hour Holter records, using 4 time domain measures of HRV (the root mean square of the successive normal sinus RR interval difference [rMSSD], percentage of successive normal sinus RR intervals >50 ms [pNN50], standard deviation of all normal sinus RR intervals during a 24-hour period [SDNN], and standard deviation of the averaged normal sinus RR intervals for all 5-minute segments [SDANN]). Autonomic modulation of the 4 measures differs, permitting distinctions between changes in HRV-parasympathetic function, using rMSSD and pNN50, and HRV-sympathetic function using SDNN and SDANN. Decade values were compared using analysis of variance and t-multiple comparison testing. The HRV of all measures decreases rapidly from the second to fifth decades. It then slows. The HRV-sympathetic function continues to decrease throughout life. In contrast, the decrease in HRV-parasympathetic function reaches its nadir in the eighth decade, followed by reversal and a progressive increase to higher levels (p <0.05), more characteristic of a younger population. In conclusion, healthy longevity depends on preservation of autonomic function, in particular, HRV-parasympathetic function, despite the early age-related decrease. The eighth decade reversal of the decrease in HRV-parasympathetic function and its subsequent increase are key determinants of longevity. Persistently high HRV in the elderly represents a marker predictive of longevity. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Minisi1991,
abstract = {91284342 Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia/Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond BACKGROUND. Left ventricular sympathetic afferent nerves are located mainly in superficial epicardial layers. Reflex excitatory responses mediated by sympathetic afferent nerves have been observed during myocardial ischemia in cats and humans but not in dogs. Previous canine studies have induced ischemia by occlusion of a coronary artery. Extensive collateral circulation in the canine heart may limit ischemia of epicardial layers during simple coronary occlusion, resulting in little stimulation of sympathetic afferent nerves and minimal reflex excitatory responses. METHODS AND RESULTS. In anesthetized dogs with sinoaortic and vagal deafferentation, we determined whether reflex sympathoexcitatory responses mediated by sympathetic afferents occurred during transmural myocardial ischemia. Reflex sympathoexcitation was quantitated by direct recording from either efferent renal (n = 20) or cardiac (n = 5) sympathetic nerves. Responses of arterial pressure and efferent sympathetic nerve activity were measured during simple occlusion of the anterior descending artery (LAD alone) and during LAD occlusion with a circumflex stenosis (LAD + CIRC). This circumflex stenosis was adjusted to abolish coronary vasodilator reserve without reducing basal flow. We observed significantly greater reflex increases in renal (32 +/- 5%) and cardiac (58 +/- 15%) nerve activity during LAD + CIRC than during LAD alone (14 +/- 6% and 8 +/- 7%, respectively). Reflex changes in renal nerve activity during LAD + CIRC were abolished by interruption of cardiac sympathetic afferent pathways (n = 5). In eight experiments, myocardial blood flow was measured during the two coronary occlusions. These experiments confirmed that LAD + CIRC elicited more transmural ischemia in the LAD distribution than did LAD alone. However, these experiments also revealed that LAD + CIRC elicited endocardial ischemia in the circumflex distribution. In five additional experiments, regional sympathetic deafferentation of the posterior left ventricle by epicardial application of 88% phenol along the atrioventricular groove had no significant effect on renal nerve responses to LAD + CIRC (36 +/- 5% increase before phenol versus 31 +/- 3% increase after phenol). These results indicate that endocardial ischemia in the circumflex distribution did not contribute to the reflex increases in nerve activity that were noted during LAD + CIRC. CONCLUSIONS. Reflex sympathoexcitation mediated by cardiac sympathetic afferents can be elicited in dogs. However, these responses are significant only during ischemia that is transmural and involves the superficial epicardial layers of the left ventricle},

abstract = {Background: The direction of the association between inflammation and depressive symptoms remains inconsistent. The objective of this study was to evaluate the temporal relationship between inflammation and depressive symptoms, and to assess the role of genetic factors on this association. Methods: In this longitudinal cross-lagged twin difference study, we examined 166 (83 pairs) middle-aged male twins recruited from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry, who were assessed at baseline and after 7 years of follow-up. We assayed plasma levels of two inflammatory biomarkers, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) and measured depressive symptoms using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI). To evaluate the direction of the association, we constructed multivariable mixed-effects regression models and calculated standardized beta-coefficients to compare the strength of the within-pair association for both pathways. We then conducted a stratified analysis by zygosity and assessed the associations in monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs separately. Results: The 166 twins were 95% white and had a mean (SD) age of 54 (3) years at baseline. The cross-lagged analysis showed significant and positive associations from visit 1 IL-6 to visit 2 BDI across all models (beta-coefficients ranging from 0.18 to 0.22). However, the opposite pathway (visit 1 BDI to visit 2 IL-6) was not significant after adjusting for confounding factors. In contrast, visit 1 BDI was significantly associated with visit 2 CRP in all models (beta-coefficients ranging from 0.23 to 0.33), while the opposite pathway (visit 1 CRP to visit 2 BDI) showed no significant association. When stratifying by zygosity, significant associations from IL-6 to depression were only seen in monozygotic twins, but associations from depression to CRP were more robust in dizygotic twins, which implies that genetic factors may play a role in this association. Conclusions: The association between inflammation and depression may be bidirectional. Elevated IL-6 levels are more likely to be a risk factor of depression rather than a consequence, while the opposite may be true for elevated CRP. The biological underpinnings of these bidirectional pathways need further evaluation.},

Experimental data show that left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD), in particular, is not only antiarrhythmic, but also antifibrillatory-an effect exquisitely important for any clinical condition associated with a high risk of ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. LCSD has additional effects on both the coronary circulation and the mechanical performance of the left ventricle, with important implications for patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy. Evidence also shows that LCSD increases the vagal activity directed to the heart, which has potential implications for the management of heart failure. In this Review, the current and novel clinical indications for LCSD are discussed, particularly in the context of results obtained in patients with channelopathies, such as long QT syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.\n},

abstract = {<h3>Importance</h3><p>Electrocardiography (ECG) may detect subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) in asymptomatic individuals, but its role in assessing adverse events beyond traditional risk factors is not clear. Interval and vector data that are commonly available on modern ECGs may offer independent prognostic information that improves risk classification.</p><h3>Objectives</h3><p>To derive and validate a CVD risk equation based on ECG metrics and to determine its incremental benefit in addition to the Framingham risk score (FRS).</p><h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3><p>This study included 3640 randomly selected community-based adults aged 40 to 74 years without known CVD from the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) cohort (1971-1975) and 6329 from the NHANES III cohort (1988-1994). Participants were sampled from across the United States. A risk score to assess incident nonfatal and fatal CVD events was derived based on computer-generated ECG data, including frontal P, R, and T axes; heart rate; and PR, QRS, and QT intervals from NHANES I. The most prognostic variables, along with age and sex, were incorporated into the NHANES ECG risk equation. The equation was evaluated in the NHANES III cohort for an independent validation. Follow-up in the NHANES III cohort was completed on December 31, 2006. Data for this study were analyzed from August 11, 2015, to May 20, 2016.</p><h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3><p>The primary end point was CVD death. Secondary outcomes included 10-year ischemic heart disease and all-cause death.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>The final study sample included 9969 participants (4714 men [47.3%]; 5255 women [52.7%]; mean [SD] age, 55.3 [10.1] years) from both cohorts. Frontal T axis, heart rate, and heart rate–corrected QT interval were the most significant ECG factors in the NHANES I cohort. In the validation cohort (NHANES III), the equation provided for prognostic information for fatal CVD with a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.23 (95% CI, 2.82-3.72); the C statistic was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.76-0.81). When added to the FRS in Cox proportional hazards regression models, the categorical (1%, 5%, and 10% cutoffs) net reclassification improvement was 24%. When the FRS and ECG scores were combined in a single model, the C statistic improved by 0.04 (95% CI, 0.02-0.06) to 0.80 (95% CI, 0.77-0.82). Similar improvements were noted when the ECG score was added to the pooled cohort equation. When the equation for prognostic information about ischemic heart disease and all-cause death was evaluated, the results were similar.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>An ECG risk score based on age, sex, heart rate, frontal T axis, and QT interval assesses the risk for CVD and compares favorably with the FRS alone in an independent cohort of asymptomatic individuals. Although the ECG risk equation is low cost, further research is needed to ascertain whether this additional step in risk stratification may improve prevention efforts and reduce CVD events.</p>},

A population-based sample of 71 men and 79 women (35-64 yrs of age) was studied. Five-minute supine recordings of ECG and beat-to-beat photoplethysmographic finger systolic arterial pressure and diastolic arterial pressure were obtained during paced breathing. Power spectra were computed using a fast Fourier transform for low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) powers. BRS was calculated by cross-spectral analysis of R-R interval and systolic arterial pressure variabilities. PFs were evaluated by 3 self-report questionnaires: the Brief Symptom Inventory, the shortened version of the Spielberger State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory, and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale. PFs were not related to HRV. Anxiety was associated with decreased BRS and higher LF power of systolic arterial pressure variability. These associations were independent of age, gender, other psychological factors, heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Hostility was an independent correlate of increased LF power of diastolic arterial pressure and increased HF power of systolic arterial pressure variability.

This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to recognize the stressful states, the Deep ECGNet, using ultra short-term raw ECG signals without any feature engineering methods. Methods: The Deep ECGNet was developed through various experiments and analysis of ECG waveforms. We proposed the optimal recurrent and convolutional neural networks architecture, and also the optimal convolution filter length (related to the P, Q, R, S, and T wave durations of ECG) and pooling length (related to the heart beat period) based on the optimization experiments and analysis on the waveform characteristics of ECG signals. The experiments were also conducted with conventional methods using HRV parameters and frequency features as a benchmark test. The data used in this study were obtained from Kwangwoon University in Korea (13 subjects, Case 1) and KU Leuven University in Bel-gium (9 subjects, Case 2). Experiments were designed according to various experimental protocols to elicit stressful conditions. Results: The proposed framework to recognize stress conditions, the Deep ECGNet, outperformed the conventional approaches with the highest accuracy of 87.39% for Case 1 and 73.96% for Case 2, respectively, that is, 16.22% and 10.98% improvements compared with those of the conventional HRV method. Conclusions: We proposed an optimal deep learning architecture and its parameters for stress recognition, and the theoretical consideration on how to design the deep learning structure based on the periodic patterns of the raw ECG data.

abstract = {Intracardiac pathways mediating the parasympathetic control of various cardiac functions are incompletely understood. Several intracardiac ganglia have been demonstrated to potently influence cardiac rate [the sinoatrial (SA) ganglion], atrioventricular (AV) conduction (the AV ganglion), or left ventricular contractility (the cranioventricular ganglion). However, there are numerous ganglia found throughout the heart whose functions are poorly characterized. One such ganglion, the posterior atrial (PA) ganglion, is found in a fat pad on the rostral dorsal surface of the right atrium. We have investigated the potential impact of this ganglion on cardiac rate and AV conduction. We report that microinjections of a ganglionic blocker into the PA ganglion significantly attenuates the negative chronotropic effects of vagal stimulation without significantly influencing negative dromotropic effects. Because prior evidence indicates that the PA ganglion does not project to the SA node, we neuroanatomically tested the hypothesis that the PA ganglion mediates its effect on cardiac rate through an interganglionic projection to the SA ganglion. Subsequent to micro-injections of the retrograde tracer fast blue into the SA ganglion, >70% of the retrogradely labeled neurons found within five intracardiac ganglia throughout the heart were observed in the PA ganglion. The neuroanatomic data further indicate that intraganglionic neuronal circuits are found within the SA ganglion. The present data support the hypothesis that two interacting cardiac centers, i.e., the SA and PA ganglia, mediate the peripheral parasympathetic control of cardiac rate. These data further support the emerging concept of an intrinsic cardiac nervous system.},

The typical takotsubo syndrome patient has a unique circumferential left (bi-) ventricular contraction abnormality profile that extends beyond a coronary artery supply territory and appears to follow the anatomical cardiac sympathetic innervation. The syndrome predominantly affects postmenopausal women and is often preceded by emotional or physical stress. Patients with predisposing factors such as malignancy and other chronic comorbidities are more prone to suffer from takotsubo syndrome. The pathogenesis of takotsubo syndrome is elusive. Several pathophysiological mechanisms involving myocardial ischemia (multivessel coronary artery spasm, microvascular dysfunction, aborted myocardial infarction), left ventricular outlet tract obstruction, blood-borne catecholamine myocardial toxicity, epinephrine-induced switch in signal trafficking, and autonomic nervous system dysfunction have been proposed. The syndrome is usually reversible; nevertheless, during the acute stage, a substantial number of patients develop severe complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure including pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock, thromboembolism, cardiac arrest, and rupture. Treatment of precipitating factors, predisposing diseases, and complications is fundamental during the acute stage of the disease. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, and management of takotsubo syndrome are reviewed in this paper.},

Prophylactic implantable-cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy has been established for post-MI patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ≤ 35%). However, most patients who die after MI have an LVEF > 35%. For this large group of patients, no specific prophylactic strategies exist. There is strong evidence that measures of cardiac autonomic dysfunction after MI provide important prognostic information in post-MI patients with preserved LVEF. Combinations of autonomic markers can identify high-risk patients after MI with LVEF > 35% whose prognosis is equally worse than that of patients with LVEF ≤ 35%. The ongoing REFINE-ICD (NCT00673842) and SMART-MI trials (NCT02594488) test different preventive strategies in high-risk post-MI patients with cardiac autonomic dysfunction and LVEF 36–50%. While REFINE-ICD follows the traditional concept of ICD-implantation, SMART-MI uses implantable cardiac monitors with remote monitoring capabilities to sensitively detect asymptomatic, but prognostically relevant arrhythmias that could trigger specific diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.},

We discuss research done after the publication of previous relevant systematic reviews, and survey currently funded research from the two most active funders in the field: the National Institutes of Health and the US Veterans Administration. We conclude that post-traumatic stress disorder is a risk factor for incident cardiovascular disease, and a common psychiatric consequence of cardiovascular disease events that might worsen the prognosis of the cardiovascular disease. There are many candidate mechanisms for the link between post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease, and several ongoing studies could soon point to the most important behavioural and physiological mechanisms to target in early phase intervention development. Similarly, targets are emerging for individual and environmental interventions that might offset the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder after cardiovascular disease events.},

abstract = {Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been linked to increased morbidity. An inflexibility of the autonomic nervous system might be the underlying mechanism. We aimed to assess whether PTSD and combat trauma exposure are associated with lower heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function and a predictor of death. Methods: We measured HRV by power spectral analysis on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram in 459 middle-aged veteran male twins. Combat trauma was assessed with the combat exposure scale, and current and remitted PTSD was assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for Psychiatry Disorders. Mixed-effects regression models were used to test associations of PTSD and HRV between and within twin pairs. Results: Of all twins, 211 had combat exposure, 31 had current PTSD, and 43 had remitted PTSD. Current PTSD was inversely associated with very-low-frequency and low-frequency HRV both in individual twins and within 20 pairs discordant for current PTSD. Twins with current PTSD had a 49% lower low-frequency HRV than their brothers without PTSD (p<.001). Remitted PTSD was not associated with HRV. Results were robust to adjustment for depression and other risk factors. Combat exposure was inversely associated with most HRV frequencies, but this association mostly diminished after adjustment for current PTSD. Conclusion: In middle-aged veteran men, combat exposure and current PTSD are associated with measures of autonomic inflexibility previously shown to have prognostic significance. The negative health impact of combat exposure on autonomic function is mediated largely through PTSD and might reverse with remission of PTSD. {\textcopyright} 2013 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract = {Proliferative enteritis is an enteric disease that affects a variety of animals. The causative agent in swine has been determined to be an obligate intracellular bacterium, Lawsonia intracellularis, related to the sulfate-reducing bacterium Desulfovibrio desulfuricans. The intracellular agents found in the lesions of different animal species are antigenically similar. In addition, strains from the pig, ferret, and hamster have been shown to be genetically similar. In this study we performed a partial 16S ribosomal DNA sequence analysis on the intracellular agent of proliferative enteritis from a hamster, a deer, and an ostrich and compared these sequences to that of the porcine L. intracellularis isolate. Results of this study indicate that the intracellular agents from these species with proliferative enteritis have high sequence similarity, indicating that they are all in the genus Lawsonia and that they may also be the same species, L. intracellularis.},

The goal of the present study was to examine associations between suicide ideation and resting HF-HRV as well as HF-HRV reactivity in a diagnostically heterogeneous sample of adult outpatients with or without concurrent suicide ideation. Participants were N = 85 outpatients (67.1% female; age: M = 38.8, SD = 13.72). HF-HRV reactivity was assessed using a sad film induction method. Associations between resting HF-HRV, HF-HRV reactivity and suicide ideation were analyzed using linear regression modeling – controlling for depression, anxiety and stress. HF-HRV reactivity towards the sad film, but not low resting HF-HRV baseline, was predictive of higher scores on suicidal ideation within the whole sample. In women, lower resting as well as perturbed HF-HRV reactivity was associated with higher scores on suicidal ideation. Results suggest that suicide ideators have a reduced capacity to regulate their response to stress.},

Experimental and clinical investigations have tested the hypothesis that the origin, progression, and outcome of human hypertension are related to dysfunctional autonomic cardiovascular control and especially to abnormal activation of the sympathetic division. Here, we review the recent literature on the adrenergic and vagal abnormalities that have been reported in essential hypertension, with emphasis on their role as promoters and as amplifiers of the high blood pressure state. We also discuss the possible mechanisms underlying these abnormalities and their importance in the development and progression of the structural and functional cardiovascular damage that characterizes hypertension. Finally, we examine the modifications of sympathetic and vagal cardiovascular influences induced by current nonpharmacological and pharmacological interventions aimed at correcting elevations in blood pressure and restoring the normotensive state.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine how neurons within the right atrial ganglionated plexus (RAGP) and posterior atrial ganglionated plexus (PAGP) interact to modulate right atrial chronotropic, dromotropic, and inotropic function, particularly with respect to their extracardiac vagal and sympathetic efferent neuronal inputs. Surgical ablation of the PAGP (PAGPx) attenuated vagally mediated bradycardia by 26%; it reduced heart rate slowing evoked by vagal stimulation superimposed on sympathetically mediated tachycardia by 36%. RAGP ablation (RAGPx) eliminated vagally mediated bradycardia, while retaining the vagally induced suppression of sympathetic-mediated tachycardia (-83%). After combined RAGPx and PAGPx, vagal stimulation still reduced sympathetic-mediated tachycardia (-47%). After RAGPx alone and after PAGPx alone, stimulation of the vagi still produced negative dromotropic effects, although these changes were attenuated compared with the intact state. Negative dromotropic responses to vagal stimulation were further attenuated after combined ablation, but parasympathetic inhibition of atrioventricular nodal conduction was still demonstrable in most animals. Finally, neither RAGPx nor PAGPx altered autonomic regulation of right atrial inotropic function. These data indicate that multiple aggregates of neurons within the intrinsic cardiac nervous system are involved in sinoatrial nodal regulation. Whereas parasympathetic efferent neurons regulating the right atrium, including the sinoatrial node, are primarily located within the RAGP, prejunctional parasympathetic-sympathetic interactions regulating right atrial function also involve neurons within the PAGP.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the stability of short recordings of heart rate variability (HRV) with time, and the association of HRV with age and sex. DESIGN: Five minute Holter recordings were made twice over a two month interval (tracking study). In addition, HRV was measured in a cross sectional study. SETTING: Residents of 11 Israeli kibbutzim were examined in their settlements. SUBJECTS: 32 men and 38 women (aged 31-67) participated in the tracking study and 294 (aged 35-65) were involved in the cross sectional study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Time and frequency domain analyses on Holter recordings were undertaken in two breathing conditions: spontaneous and controlled breathing (15 respirations per minute). Regression was used to assess the relations of sex, age, heart rate, and logarithmically transformed HRV indices. RESULTS: HRV measures were highly consistent with time with correlations of 0.76-0.80 for high frequency and total power. Geometric mean total power declined with age by 45% in men and 32% in women, and was lower by 24% among women than among men (all p < or = 0.005). Men had a 34% higher very low and low frequency power and a higher ratio of low to high frequency power (p < 0.001). Conversely, high frequency power in women represents a greater proportion of total power than in men. CONCLUSION: Short recordings of HRV in a non-laboratory setting are stable over months and therefore characteristic of an individual. Strong age and sex effects were evident. HRV derived from short recordings can be informative in population based studies.},

abstract = {Repeated single exposures to social stressors induce robust shifts of cardiac sympathovagal balance toward sympathetic dominance both during and after each agonistic interaction. However, little evidence is available regarding possible persistent pathophysiological changes due to chronic social challenge. In this study, male CD-1 mice (n = 14) were implanted with a radiotelemetry system for electrocardiographic recordings. We assessed the effects of chronic psychosocial stress (15-day sensory contact with a dominant animal and daily 5-min defeat episodes) on 1) sympathovagal responsiveness to each defeat episode, as measured via time-domain indexes of heart rate variability (R-R interval, standard deviation of R-R interval, and root mean square ofsto successive R-R interval differences), 2) circadian rhythmicity of heart rate across the chronic challenge (night phase, day phase, and rhythm amplitude values), and 3) amount of myocardial structural damage (volume fraction, density, and extension of fibrosis). This study indicated that there was habituation of acute cardiac autonomic responsiveness, i.e., the shift of sympathovagal balance toward sympathetic dominance was significantly reduced across repeated defeat episodes. Moreover, animals exhibited significant changes in heart rate rhythmicity, i.e., increments in day and night values and reductions in the rhythm amplitude, but these were limited to the first 5 days of chronic psychosocial stress. The volume fraction of fibrosis was sixfold larger than in control animals, because of the appearance of many microscopic scarrings. In summary, although mice appeared to adapt to chronic psychosocial stress in terms of acute cardiovascular responsiveness and heart rate rhythmicity, structural alterations occurred at the myocardial level.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Decreased heart rate variability (HRV) and abnormal nonlinear HRV shortly after myocardial infarction (MI) are risk factors for mortality. Traditional HRV predicts mortality in patients with a range of times post-MI, but the association of nonlinear HRV and outcome in this population is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: HRV was determined from 740 tapes recorded before antiarrhythmic therapy in Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial patients with ventricular premature contractions (VPCs) suppressed on the first randomized treatment. Patients were 70 +/- 121 days post-MI. Follow up was 362 +/- 241 days (70 deaths). The association between traditional time and frequency-domain HRV and mortality and nonlinear HRV and mortality were compared for the entire population (ALL), those without coronary artery bypass graft post-MI (no CABG), and those without CABG or diabetes (no CABG, no DIAB) using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Strength of association was compared by P values and Wald Chi-square values. Nonlinear HRV included short-term fractal scaling exponent, power law slope, and SD12 (Poincare dimension). For ALL and for no CABG, increased daytime SD12 had the strongest association with mortality (P=0.002 ALL and P <0.001 no CABG). For no CABG, no DIAB increased 24-hour SD12 hours had the strongest association (P <0.001) with mortality. Upon multivariate analysis, increased SD12, decreased ln ULF (ultra low frequency), and history of prior MI and history of congestive heart failure each remained in the model. CONCLUSION: Nonlinear HRV is associated with mortality post-MI. However, as with traditional HRV, this is diluted by CABG surgery post-MI and by diabetes. Results suggest that decreased long-term HRV and increased randomness of heart rate are each independent risk factors for mortality post-MI.},

abstract = {Importance Depressive symptoms are associated with lower heart rate variability (HRV), an index of autonomic dysregulation, but the direction of the association remains unclear. Objective To investigate the temporal association between depression and HRV. Design, Settings, and Participants A longitudinal, cross-lagged twin difference study, with baseline assessments from March 2002 to March 2006 (visit 1) and a 7-year follow-up (visit 2) at an academic research center with participants recruited from a national twin registry. Twins (n = 166) from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry, who served in the US military during the Vietnam War, and were discordant for depression at baseline were recruited. Main Outcomes and Measures At both visits, depressive symptoms were measured using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and HRV was measured through 24-hour electrocardiogram monitoring. To assess the direction of the association, within-pair differences in multivariable mixed-effects regression models were examined, and standardized $\beta$ coefficients for both pathways were calculated. The associations were evaluated separately in monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Results In the final analytic sample (N = 146), all participants were men, 138 (95%) were white, and the mean (SD) age was 54 (3) years at baseline. Results showed consistent associations between visit 1 HRV and visit 2 BDI score across all HRV domains and models ($\beta$ coefficients ranging from −0.14 to −0.29), which were not explained by antidepressants or other participant characteristics. The magnitude of the association was similar in the opposite pathway linking visit 1 BDI score to visit 2 HRV, with $\beta$ coefficients ranging from 0.05 to −0.30, but it was largely explained by antidepressant use. In stratified analysis by zygosity, significant associations were observed in monozygotic and dizygotic twins for the path linking visit 1 HRV to visit 2 BDI score, although the associations were slightly stronger in dizygotic twins. Conclusions and Relevance The association between depression and autonomic dysregulation, indexed by HRV, is bidirectional, with stronger evidence suggesting that autonomic function affects depression risk rather than vice versa. The opposite causal pathway from depression to lower HRV is mostly driven by antidepressant use. These findings highlight an important role of autonomic nervous system in the risk of depression and contribute new understanding of the mechanisms underlying the comorbidity of depression and cardiovascular disease.},

abstract = {Decreased heart rate (HR) variability is associated with increased mortality after myocardial infarction, but the prognostic value of HR variability in patients without recent myocardial infarction and its correlation with other clinical and angiographic data have not previously been reported. In the present study, detailed clinical assessments and 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms were performed prospectively on 100 patients undergoing elective coronary angiography. HR variability was inversely correlated with HR (r = -0.38, p = 0.0001), diabetes mellitus (r = -0.22, p = 0.025) and digoxin use (r = -0.29, p = 0.004), but not with left ventricular ejection fraction, extent of coronary artery disease or other clinical, electrocardiographic or angiographic variables. All patients were followed for 1 year. Major clinical events after initial discharge occurred in 10 patients and included 6 deaths and 4 coronary bypass operations. Left ventricular ejection fraction was the only variable that correlated with the occurrence of a clinical event (p = 0.002). Decreased HR variability and ejection fraction were the best predictors of mortality (both p < 0.01), and the contribution of HR variability to mortality was independent of ejection fraction, extent of coronary artery disease and other variables. Furthermore, 11 patients with HR variability <50 ms had an 18-fold increase in mortality compared with patients with HR variability >50 ms (36 vs 2%, p = 0.001). Thus, decreased HR variability is a potent independent predictor of mortality in the 12 months following elective coronary angiography in patients without recent myocardial infarction. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {There is continuing belief that cardiac parasympathetic postganglionic fibres are sparse or absent from the ventricles. This review of the literature shows that the supposition is a myth. Early studies considered that fine silver-stained fibres coursing amongst ventricle myocardial cells were most likely cardiac parasympathetic postganglionic fibres. The conclusions were later supported by acetyl cholinesterase staining using a method that appeared not to be associated with noradrenaline nerve fibres. The conclusion is critically examined in the light of several recent histological studies using the acetyl cholinesterase method and also a more definitive technique (CHAT), that suggest a widespread location of parasympathetic ganglia and a relatively dense parasympathetic innervation of ventricular muscle in a range of mammals including man. The many studies demonstrating acetylcholine release in the ventricle on vagal nerve stimulation and a high density of acetylcholine M2 receptors is in accord with this as are tests of ventricular performance from many physiological studies. Selective control of cardiac functions by anatomically segregated parasympathetic ganglia is discussed. It is argued that the influence of vagal stimulation on ventricular myocardial action potential refractory period, duration, force and rhythm is evidence that vagal fibres have close apposition to myocardial fibres. This is supported by clear evidence of accentuated antagonism between sympathetic activity and vagal activity in the ventricle and also by direct effects of vagal activity independent of sympathetic activity. The idea of differential control of atrial and ventricular physiology by vagal C and vagal B preganglionic fibres is examined as well as differences in chemical phenotypes and their function. The latter is reflected in medullary and supramedullary control. Reference is made to the importance of this knowledge to understanding the normal physiology of cardiac autonomic control and significance to pathology.},

Mental stress caused significant increases (P < 0.01) in serum epinephrine (26 +/- 16 vs. 42 +/- 17 pg/ml), norepinephrine (272 +/- 139 vs. 322 +/- 136 pg/ml), and cardiac work [rate-pressure product (RPP) 8,011 +/- 1,884 vs. 10,416 +/- 2,711]. Stress-induced changes in cardiac work were correlated with changes in MBF (r = 0.72; P < 0.01). Multiple-regression analysis revealed stress-induced changes in the RPP as the only significant (P = 0.0001) predictor for the magnitude of mental stress-induced increases in MBF in healthy individuals. Data from this group of healthy individuals should prove useful to investigate coronary vasomotion in individuals at risk for or with documented coronary artery disease.},

abstract = {The autonomic nervous system plays an important role in the modulation of cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmogenesis. Decades of research has contributed to a better understanding of the anatomy and physiology of cardiac autonomic nervous system and provided evidence supporting the relationship of autonomic tone to clinically significant arrhythmias. The mechanisms by which autonomic activation is arrhythmogenic or antiarrhythmic are complex and different for specific arrhythmias. In atrial fibrillation, simultaneous sympathetic and parasympathetic activations are the most common trigger. In contrast, in ventricular fibrillation in the setting of cardiac ischemia, sympathetic activation is proarrhythmic, whereas parasympathetic activation is antiarrhythmic. In inherited arrhythmia syndromes, sympathetic stimulation precipitates ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac death except in Brugada and J-wave syndromes where it can prevent them. The identification of specific autonomic triggers in different arrhythmias has brought the idea of modulating autonomic activities for both preventing and treating these arrhythmias. This has been achieved by either neural ablation or stimulation. Neural modulation as a treatment for arrhythmias has been well established in certain diseases, such as long QT syndrome. However, in most other arrhythmia diseases, it is still an emerging modality and under investigation. Recent preliminary trials have yielded encouraging results. Further larger-scale clinical studies are necessary before widespread application can be recommended.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE The primary aim of this secondary analysis was to determine whether cardiac autonomic neuropathy independently predicted adverse cardiac outcomes in asymptomatic individuals with type 2 diabetes. Additional aims include the determination of the correlation of standard autonomic testing measures and power spectral analysis of heart rate variability, and the association of diabetes-related and cardiac risk factors with cardiac autonomic neuropathy measures. METHODS Cardiac autonomic neuropathy was assessed at the study entry into the Detection of Ischemia in Asymptomatic Diabetics study, using autonomic heart rate and blood pressure testing, and power spectral analysis of heart rate variability. All participants were prospectively followed for the composite clinical outcome of cardiac death, acute coronary syndromes, heart failure, or coronary revascularization. RESULTS Over 5 years of follow-up, 94 of 1119 (8.4%) subjects developed symptomatic cardiac disease. In unadjusted bivariate analyses, abnormalities in several cardiac autonomic neuropathy tests, including lower Valsalva and Standing Heart Rate Ratios, higher resting Heart Rate, greater systolic blood pressure decrease on standing, and lower low-frequency power, were predictive of symptomatic disease. Independent predictors of poor cardiac outcome were a lower Valsalva Heart Rate Ratio, non-Black ethnicity, longer diabetes duration, higher glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin use, reported numbness in the extremities, higher pulse pressure, family history of coronary artery disease, and higher waist-to-hip ratio. Clinical factors independently associated with a lower Valsalva Heart Rate Ratio were insulin use, clinical proteinuria, higher pulse pressure, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and non-Black ethnicity. CONCLUSION Cardiac autonomic neuropathy predicted adverse cardiac outcomes in asymptomatic type 2 diabetes without known cardiac disease. Clinical variables may help to identify patients who might have cardiac autonomic neuropathy and warrant consideration for autonomic testing.},

abstract = {Context: Major depressive disorder (MDD) associated with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) increases the risk of mortality. Decreased heart rate variability (HRV), also a predictor of mortality, is reduced in patients with MDD after ACS, and has been suggested to be a mediator of MDD mortality after ACS. Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may reduce mortality post-ACS, little is known about their effects on HRV. Objective: To examine the influence of both sertraline and improvement in mood on HRV. Methods: The Sertraline Antidepressant Heart Attack Randomized Trial assessed HRV from 24-hour Holter electrocardiogram recordings at baseline in 290 patients and from a second recording in 258 of these patients 16 weeks after randomization to sertraline or placebo. Frequency domain measures of HRV included high-frequency power, low-frequency power, very low-frequency power, ultra low-frequency power, and total power. Depression severity was measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Clinical response was measured with the Clinical Global Impressions Improvement scale. Results: At baseline, prior episodes of MDD were associated with lower HRV. Sertraline significantly increased ultra low-frequency power, while improvement in mood was associated with higher low-frequency power independent of treatment. However, the expected recovery in HRV following ACS was not observed in patients with MDD. Higher ultra low-frequency during sertraline treatment and higher low-frequency power in patients whose mood improved resulted primarily from these measures decreasing in their comparison groups. Conclusions: Heart rate variability recovery is impaired in depressed patients after ACS. Previously reported differences in baseline HRV between patients with and without depression after ACS grew larger in the 16 weeks following a coronary event. Both sertraline treatment and symptomatic recovery from depression were associated with increased HRV compared with placebotreated and nonrecovered post-ACS control groups, respectively, but this results primarily from decreased HRV in the comparison groups.},

abstract = {Serotonin (5-HT) is crucial to normal reflex vagal modulation of heart rate (HR). Reduced baroreflex sensitivity [spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (sBRS)] and HR variability (HRV) reflect impaired neural, particularly vagal, control of HR and are independently associated with depression. In conscious, telemetered Flinders-Sensitive Line (FSL) rats, a well-validated animal model of depression, we tested the hypothesis that cardiovascular regulatory abnormalities are present and associated with deficient serotonergic control of reflex cardiovagal function. In FSL rats and control Flinders-Resistant (FRL) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat strains, diurnal measurements of HR, arterial pressure (AP), activity, sBRS, and HRV were made. All strains had normal and similar diurnal variations in HR, AP, and activity. In FRL rats, HR was elevated, contributing to the reduced HRV and sBRS in this strain. In FSL rats, sBRS and high-frequency power HRV were reduced during the night, indicating reduced reflex cardiovagal activity. The ratio of low- to high-frequency bands of HRV was increased in FSL rats, suggesting a relative predominance of cardiac sympathetic and/or reflex activity compared with FRL and SD rats. These data show that conscious FSL rats have cardiovascular regulatory abnormalities similar to depressed humans. Acute changes in HR, AP, temperature, and sBRS in response to 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin, a 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(1B), and 5-HT(7) receptor agonist, were also determined. In FSL rats, despite inducing an exaggerated hypothermic effect, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin did not decrease HR and AP or improve sBRS, suggesting impaired serotonergic neural control of cardiovagal activity. These data suggest that impaired serotonergic control of cardiac reflex function could be one mechanism linking reduced sBRS to increased cardiac risk in depression.},

This randomized controlled trial compared the efficacy of self-help physical activity (PA), mindfulness meditation (MM), and heart rate variability biofeedback (HRV-BF) in reducing stress and its related symptoms. We randomly allocated 126 participants to PA, MM, or HRV-BF upon enrollment, of whom 76 agreed to participate. The interventions consisted of psycho-education and an introduction to the specific intervention techniques and 5 weeks of daily exercises at home. The PA exercises consisted of a vigorous-intensity activity of free choice. The MM exercises consisted of guided mindfulness meditation. The HRV-BF exercises consisted of slow breathing with a heart rate variability biofeedback device. Participants received daily reminders for their exercises and were contacted weekly to monitor their progress. They completed questionnaires prior to, directly after, and 6 weeks after the intervention. Results indicated an overall beneficial effect consisting of reduced stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and improved psychological well-being and sleep quality. No significant between-intervention effect was found, suggesting that PA, MM, and HRV-BF are equally effective in reducing stress and its related symptoms.

abstract = {Depression occurs in people of all ages across all world regions; it is the second leading cause of disability and its global burden increased by 37.5% between 1990 and 2010. Autonomic changes are often found in altered mood states and appear to be a central biological substrate linking depression to a number of physical dysfunctions. Alterations of autonomic nervous system functioning that promotes vagal withdrawal are reflected in reductions of heart rate variability (HRV) indexes. Reduced HRV characterizes emotional dysregulation, decreased psychological flexibility and defective social engagement, which in turn are linked to prefrontal cortex hypoactivity. Altogether, these pieces of evidence support the idea that HRV might represent a useful endophenotype for psychological/physical comorbidities, and its routine application should be advised to assess the efficacy of prevention/intervention therapies in a number of psychosomatic and psychiatric dysfunctions. Further research, also making use of appropriate animal models, could provide a significant support to this point of view and possibly help to identify appropriate antidepressant therapies that do not interefere with physical health.},

abstract = {Background: Studies have linked depression to sudden death and serious cardiovascular events in patients with preexisting cardiac illness. Recent studies have shown decreased vagal function in cardiac patients with depression and depressed patients without cardiac illness. Methods: We compared 20-hour, sleeping, and awake heart period variability measures using spectral analysis, fractal dimension, and symbolic dynamics in two patient groups with major depression and ischemic heart disease (mean age 59-60 years) before and after 6 weeks of paroxetine or nortriptyline treatment. Results: Spectral measures showed decreases in awake and sleeping total power (TP: 0.0-0.5 Hz), ultra low frequency power (ULF: 0-0.0033 Hz), very low frequency power (VLF: 0.0033-0.04 Hz), and low-frequency power (LF: 0.04-0.15 Hz) for nortriptyline condition and a decrease in high-frequency power (HF: 0.15-0.5 Hz) for the awake condition in patients who received nortriptyline. A measure of nonlinear complexity, WC-100, significantly increased after paroxetine during the awake condition. Conclusions: These findings suggest that nortriptyline has stronger vagolytic effects on cardiac autonomic function compared with paroxetine, which is in agreement with previous clinical and preclinical reports. Paroxetine may have some cardio-protective effects, especially in cardiac patients. {\textcopyright} 2002 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

This study was designed to re-investigate this topic with a larger N than has heretofore been used. Methods: The electrocardiogram was recorded during left and right ISAs in 73 subjects. Raw heart rate and heart rate variability were calculated. Results: Raw heart rate increased during inactivation of either hemisphere, but more so for the right hemisphere. Heart rate variability changes consistent with decreasing parasympa-thetic tone also were found to occur during either ISA, but to a significant degree, only during right ISA. Conclusions: The right hemisphere appears to have a greater role in cerebral regulation of cardiac function, perhaps by virtue of the modification of parasympathetic effects.},

abstract = {Dysfunction of the intrinsic cardiac nervous system is implicated in the genesis of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. While this system has been studied extensively in animal models, far less is known about the intrinsic cardiac nervous system of humans. This study was initiated to anatomically identify neurotransmitters associated with the right atrial ganglionated plexus (RAGP) of the human heart. Biopsies of epicardial fat containing a portion of the RAGP were collected from eight patients during cardiothoracic surgery and processed for immunofluorescent detection of specific neuronal markers. Colocalization of markers was evaluated by confocal microscopy. Most intrinsic cardiac neuronal somata displayed immunoreactivity for the cholinergic marker choline acetyltransferase and the nitrergic marker neuronal nitric oxide synthase. A subpopulation of intrinsic cardiac neurons also stained for noradrenergic markers. While most intrinsic cardiac neurons received cholinergic innervation evident as punctate immunostaining for the high affinity choline transporter, some lacked cholinergic inputs. Moreover, peptidergic, nitrergic, and noradrenergic nerves provided substantial innervation of intrinsic cardiac ganglia. These findings demonstrate that the human RAGP has a complex neurochemical anatomy, which includes the presence of a dual cholinergic/nitrergic phenotype for most of its neurons, the presence of noradrenergic markers in a subpopulation of neurons, and innervation by a host of neurochemically distinct nerves. The putative role of multiple neurotransmitters in controlling intrinsic cardiac neurons and mediating efferent signaling to the heart indicates the possibility of novel therapeutic targets for arrhythmia prevention. {\textcopyright} 2009 IBRO.},

Over the next decade, it is predicted that treatment of these conditions, in particular, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), along with its associated long-term comorbidities, will challenge the health care system. Multiple organ systems are adversely affected by PTSD, and PTSD is linked to cancer, arthritis, digestive disease, and cardiovascular disease. Evidence for a strong link between PTSD and cardiovascular disease is compelling, and this review describes current clinical data linking PTSD to cardiovascular disease, via inflammation, autonomic dysfunction, and the renin-angiotensin system. Recent clinical and preclinical evidence regarding the role of the renin-angiotensin system in the extinction of fear memory and relevance in PTSD-related immune and autonomic dysfunction is also addressed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purposes of this study were to assess the long-term effect of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) on blood pressure (BP) trajectories from childhood to young adulthood and to examine whether this relation is explained by childhood socioeconomic status (SES) or risk behaviors that are associated with ACEs. METHODS AND RESULTS: Systolic and diastolic BPs were measured up to 16 times (13 times on average) over a 23-year period in 213 African Americans and 181 European Americans 5 to 38 years of age. Retrospective data on traumatic experiences before 18 years of age were collected, including abuse, neglect, and household dysfunction. Individual growth curve modeling within a multilevel framework was used to examine the relation between exposure to ACEs and BP development. No main effect of ACEs on average BP levels was found. However, a significant interaction of ACE score with age(3) was observed (systolic BP, P=0.033; diastolic BP, P=0.017). Subjects who experienced multiple traumatic events during childhood showed a faster rise in BP levels after 30 years of age than those without ACEs. As expected, a graded association of ACEs with childhood socioeconomic status and negative health behaviors was observed (P<0.001). The ACE-systolic BP relation was not explained by these factors, whereas the ACE-diastolic BP relation was partially mediated by illicit drug use. CONCLUSION: In this novel longitudinal study, we observed that participants who were exposed to multiple ACEs displayed a greater increase in BP levels in young adulthood compared with their counterparts without ACEs.},

Early-life stressors, such as childhood abuse and early socioeconomic adversity, are linked to increased cardiovascular morbidity in adulthood. Our updated meta-analyses of prospective studies published until 2011 show a 1.5-fold (95% confidence interval 1.2–1.9) increased risk of coronary heart disease among adults experiencing social isolation and a 1.3-fold (1.2–1.5) excess risk for workplace stress; adverse metabolic changes are one of the underlying plausible mechanisms. Stress, anger, and depressed mood can act as acute triggers of major cardiac events; the pooled relative risk of acute coronary syndrome onset being preceded by stress is 2.5 (1.8–3.5) in case-crossover studies. Stress is also implicated in the prognosis of cardiovascular disease and in the development of stress (takotsubo) cardiomyopathy. A major challenge over the next decade is to incorporate stress processes into the mainstream of cardiovascular pathophysiological research and understanding.},

abstract = {The influence of tonic sympathetic and parasym-pathetic nervous system activity on ventricular refractory period duration was studied in 13 mongrel dogs. Strength-interval curves were obtained from the apex of the right ventricular endocardium with a transvenous bipolar catheter. The effects of sympathetic activity were assessed by unilateral and bilateral steUectomies and tonic vagal effects were studied by inducing cholinergic blockade with atropine (0.2 mg/kg) and by sectioning the cervical vagi bilaterally. Right stellectomy shifted the strength-interval curve 3-5 msec earlier (P < 0.005). In contrast, left stellectomy shifted the strength-interval curve 4-7 msec later (P < 0.001). Thus, right and left unilateral stellectomy produced opposite effects. However, when the contralateral ganglion was removed, right and left stellectomy produced qualitatively similar effects, increasing refractoriness. The net effect of bilateral stellectomy was to shift the strength-interval curve 8-10 msec later (P < 0.001) and this was primarily dependent on left stellectomy. Blockade of vagal efferent activity with atropine shifted the strength-interval curve 3-6 msec earlier (P = 0.001). Removal of vagal afferent activity by vagotomy during atropine blockade shifted the strength-interval curve 2-3 msec earlier (P = 0.03). It is concluded that both stellate ganglia exert qualitatively similar effects on cardiac refractoriness; however, the left ganglion dominates and unilateral right stellectomy produces a paradoxical decrease in refractoriness. The sympathetic effects are tonically antagonized by vagal activity. IT HAS BEEN hypothesized that electrical asymmetry of the cardiac conducting system predisposes to reentrant arrhythmias leading to ventricular fibrillation.'• 2 It is well established that stimulation of the midbrain reticular formation and of areas in the diencephalon and rhinence-phalon produces electrocardiographic changes and a diversity of arrhythmias. 3 "* The rhythm disorders that result from central neural system stimulation may be related to inhomogeneities induced in cardiac excitability. Indeed right-and left-sided sympathetic efferent outflow is distributed to different areas of the ventricular myocardium. 7 Opposite sides of the brain, furthermore, exert different effects on the heart. Thus in the cat. right hypothalamic stimulation decreases T wave amplitude, whereas a rise in amplitude attends stimulation of the contralateral side. 8 In dogs, left stellate ganglion stimulation or right stellectomy prolongs the Q-T interval and increases T wave amplitude. whereas right-sided stimulation or left stellectomy results in Twave inversion without affecting the Q-T duration. 9 It also has been demonstrated that the stellate ganglia differ in their effects on ventricular vulnerability. Ablation of the left stellate ganglion reduces the prevalence of arrhyth-mias following coronary artery occlusion and raises the ventricular fibrillation threshold, whereas an opposite effect results when the right ganglion is removed. sympathetic vagal system profoundly affects ventricular excitability. l2> ' 3 The effects of the vagus, however, are influenced substantially by the prevailing level of adrener-gic tone. 14 ' l5 These considerations have guided the modeling of the present investigation, the aim of which was to define the distinctive effects of the right and left stellate ganglia on ventricular excitability. The specific objectives were the following: (1) to determine the effect of tonic cardiac sympathetic outflow on ventricular excitability; (2) to evaluate the relative roles of right and left stellate ganglia; and (3) to assess the contribution of tonic vagal activity. Methods Thirteen mongrel dogs weighing 16-21 kg were anes-thetized with intravenous a-chloralose. 100 mg/kg. A stabilization period of at least 20 minutes was allowed between anesthetic administration and experimental interventions. Artificial ventilation was instituted using a Har-vard respirator that supplied room air via a cuffed endo-tracheal tube. A polyethylene catheter was inserted into a femoral artery for sampling arterial blood and for monitoring blood pressure. The respirator was adjusted to maintain arterial pH between 7.35 and 7.50 and PO 2 at greater than 90 mm Hg. Rectal temperature was maintained at 37 ± 1°C with a thermal blanket. Systemic arterial pressure was monitored continuously with a Sta-tham P23Db transducer. Mean pressures were obtained by electrically integrating the output of the transducer. Cervical vagosympathetic trunks were exposed bilaterally 2 cm below the level of the carotid bifurcation. Bilateral thoracotomies were performed in the 2nd intercostal space to expose the stellate ganglia. Drugs were administered via a femoral venous catheter.

abstract = {Low heart rate (HR) variability is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but the causes and mechanisms of this association are not well known. This prospective study was designed to test the hypothesis that reduced HR variability is related to progression of coronary atherosclerosis. Average HR and HR variability were analyzed in 12-hour ambulatory ECG recordings from 265 qualified patients participating in a multicenter study to evaluate the angiographic progression of coronary artery disease in patients with prior coronary artery bypass surgery and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations (<1.1 mmol/L). Participants were randomized to receive a placebo or gemfibrozil therapy. The progression of coronary atherosclerosis was estimated by quantitative, computer-assisted analysis of coronary artery stenoses from the baseline angiograms and from repeated angiograms performed an average of 32 months later. The progression of focal coronary atherosclerosis of the patients randomized to placebo therapy was more marked in the tertile with the lowest standard deviation of all normal to normal R-R intervals (SDNN, 74+/-13 ms; mean decrease in the per-patient minimum luminal diameter -0.17 mm; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.23 to -0.12 mm) than in the middle tertile (SDNN, 107+/-7 ms; mean decrease -0.05 mm; 95% CI, -0.08 to -0.01 mm) or highest tertile (SDNN, 145+/-25 ms; mean change 0.01 mm; 95% CI, -0. 04 to 0.02 mm) (P<0.001 between the tertiles). This association was abolished by gemfibrozil. SDNN was lower (P<0.001) and minimum HR was faster (P<0.01) in the patients with marked progression than in those with regression of focal coronary atherosclerosis. In multiple regression analysis including HR variability, minimum HR, demographic and clinical variables, smoking, blood pressure, glucose, lipid measurements and lipid-modifying therapy, progression of focal coronary atherosclerosis was independently predicted by the SDNN (beta=0.24; P=0.0001). Low HR variability analyzed from ambulatory ECG predicts rapid progression of coronary artery disease. HR variability provided information on progression of focal coronary atherosclerosis beyond that obtained by traditional risk markers of atherosclerosis.},

Methods In the context of the ATTICA Study (2002-2012), 853 adult participants without previous CVD history (453 men (45+/-13 years) and 400 women (44+/-18 years)) underwent psychological evaluations through validated, self-reporting depression and anxiety questionnaires. Results After adjustment for multiple established CVD risk factors, both reported depression and anxiety levels were positively and independently associated with the 10-year CVD incidence, with depression markedly increasing the CVD risk by approximately fourfold (adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 3.6 (1.3, 11) for depression status; 1.03 (1.0, 1.1) for anxiety levels). Conclusions Our findings indicate that standardised psychological assessments focusing on depression and anxiety should be considered as an additional and distinct aspect in the context of CVD preventive strategies that are designed and implemented by health authorities at the general population level.},

We measured resting heart rate and heart rate variability in 13,241 adults (45- to 64-years old) followed for a median of 16 years in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. We examined heart rate parameters by quartiles, defining those in the lowest quartile (by time and frequency domain measures separately) as the risk group of interest. We identified 199 cases of incident ESRD and 541 patients with CKD-related hospitalizations; higher resting heart rate and lower heart rate variability associated with both outcomes. The fully adjusted hazard ratios for ESRD were 1.98 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.45 to 2.70) among those in the highest heart rate quartile and 1.56 (95% CI 1.14 to 2.14) for high-frequency power.

In our study, we stored a modified chest wall electrocardiogram on magnetic tape (Tracker, Reynolds) for later analysis (Pathfinder IV, RR-tools, Reynolds). 15 volunteers performed controlled respiration at six different 6 min-intervals: below the low-frequency range (LF) of the power spectrum (0.03 Hz), within LF (0.08, 0.10 and 0.13 Hz), within the high-frequency range (HF; 0.25 Hz), and above HF (0.50 Hz). HRV was expressed in the time domain in terms of standard deviation (SDNN), root mean square successive difference (RMSSD) and the percentage of differences between adjacent normal RR intervals that are > 50 ms (pNN50). After fast Fourier transformation, HRV was expressed in the frequency domain in terms of LF power (0.05–0.15 Hz), HF power (0.15–0.45 Hz), and the ratio (R) of LF to HF. Heart rate (72 ± 11 min-1) remained unchanged throughout the protocol, indicating a steady haemodynamic state. HRV differed up to 33 % in SDNN, 37 % in RMSSD and 75 % in pNN50 between the different respiration rates. LF power differed up to 72 % (p < 0.10), HF power up to 36 % and R up to 48 % (p < 0.10). Reproducibility seems satisfactory for the short-term analysis. Respiration rate-induced changes in the time domain meas- urements were not significant. Because of the large scatter of RMSSD and pNN50, we suggest SDNN as a reliable, easily accessible, and illustrative measurement for assessment of HRV. Respiration clearly affected the frequency domain measure- ments of HRV via shifts in the respiratory sinus arrhythmia. If major changes in respiration rate are to be expected, these should be interpreted with caution. On the other hand, the characteristic RSA-induced shifts in the frequency range could possibly be useful to determine respiration rate in freely moving individuals.

abstract = {In this paper, we develop a physiological oscillator model of which the output mimics the shape of the R-R interval Poincar{{\'{e}}} plot. To validate the model, simulations of various nervous conditions are compared with heart rate variability (HRV) data obtained from subjects under each prescribed condition. For a variety of sympathovagal balances, our model generates Poincar{{\'{e}}} plots that undergo alterations strongly resembling those of actual R-R intervals. By exploiting the oscillator basis of our model, we detail the way that low- and high-frequency modulation of the sinus node translates into R-R interval Poincar{{\'{e}}} plot shape by way of simulations and analytic results. With the use of our model, we establish that the length and width of a Poincar{{\'{e}}} plot are a weighted combination of low- and high-frequency power. This provides a theoretical link between frequency-domain spectral analysis techniques and time-domain Poincar{{\'{e}}} plot analysis. We ascertain the degree to which these principles apply to real R-R intervals by testing the mathematical relationships on a set of data and establish that the principles are clearly evident in actual HRV records.},
