Physiological basis of brain-heart interactions
===============================================

Neurocardiology
---------------

1.  Historical studies of brain affecting the heart

    1.  Increased nervous activity can lead to sudden death through
        ventricular fibrillation.(Lown, Verrier, & Rabinowitz, 1977)

        1.  Animal models show that brain stimulation can lead to
            ventricular fibrillation, including through chemical
            means.(Goodman Levy, 1914)

        2.  In susceptible myocardium, such as after myocardial
            ischemia, central nervous stimulation can trigger
            ventricular fibrillation more readily.(Kolman, Verrier, &
            Lown, 1975)

        3.  Increased psychological stress reduces threshold for
            ventricular response, suggesting electrical instability in
            canine model.(Lown, Verrier, & Corbalan, 1973)

2.  Relevant cardiac anatomy

    1.  Pathways between heart and brain are complex.(Davis &
        Natelson, 1993)

    2.  Important anatomy includes: medullary (parasympathetic) and
        spinal cord (sympathetic efferent neurons, afferent inputs to
        CNS from arterial and cardiac wall mechanosensors.(Williamson,
        Fadel, & Mitchell, 2006)

    3.  **Potential Figure** showing complexity of cardiac anatomy
        ![Armour sketch of cardiac nervous
        system](media/image1.png){width="3.6452023184601923in"
        height="3.7685181539807524in"}

    4.  Highlighting difference between intrinsic cardiac ganglia,
        intrathoracic extracardiac ganglia, and CNS, such that there is
        limited/unknown sympathetic afferent neurons from heart to
        higher levels.(Armour, 2010; Coote, 2013)

    5.  Combination of abnormal cardiac myocyte and cardiac nervous
        system effect overall cardiac function.(Armour, 2008)

    6.  Supramedullary effects are also present, such that the left and
        right insular stimulation creates different effects in
        bradycardia with the left, and tachycardia with the
        right.(Oppenheimer, Gelb, Girvin, & Hachinski, 1992)

Autonomic nervous system affect on cardiovascular system
--------------------------------------------------------

1.  Sympathetic nervous system

    1.  Stimulation of the stellate ganglion in canine models had
        increased chance of causing ventricular fibrillation
        particularly after coronary occlusion.(Harris, Otero, &
        Bocage, 1971)

    2.  Stellate ganglion thought to be carrying efferent sympathetic
        fibers. After stellate ganglionectomy, the VF threshold
        increased to 11% from 31% (compared to control VF rate).(Kliks,
        Burgess, & Abildskov, 1975)

    3.  Affect is complicated however, as unilateral stellectomy may
        have compensatory contralateral activation, and then are
        agonized by vagal activity.(Schwartz, Verrier, & Lown, 1977)
        ![Schwartz figure on vagotomy and stellectomy to
        VF](media/image2.png){width="4.0758311461067365in"
        height="1.4814818460192476in"}

2.  Parasympathetic nervous system

    1.  Vagal influence was not thought to be salutary independently, it
        only provided protection to VF threshold with concurrent
        increased sympathetic tone.(Kolman et al., 1975)

    2.  Vagal nerve asks through muscarinic, nicotinic, and adrenergic
        signals, such as methachole could raise ventricular vulnerable
        threshold, which could reduced with atropine.(Rabinowitz,
        Verrier, & Lown, 1976)

    3.  Vagal activity is controversial, as sympathetic-independent
        nitrergic parasympathetic postganglionic nerves can
        independently provide ventricular protection and decrease SA-AV
        conduction.(Brack, Coote, & Ng, 2011; Brack, Patel, Coote, & Ng,
        2007; Coote, 2013; Ng, Brack, & Coote, 2001) ![Coote figure on
        cardiac vagus
        nerve](media/image3.png){width="3.2507075678040245in"
        height="1.8611111111111112in"}

    4.  Multiple types of cardiac vagal preganglionic neurons exist in
        the medulla in feline models, one affected by respiration and
        one that was not.(Daly & Kirkman, 1989)

Measurement of brain-heart interactions
=======================================

Invasive measurements
---------------------

1.  Electrical measurements

    1.  Microneurography

        1.  Multiunit postganglionic sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA)
            can be recorded from the peroneal nerve using
            microneurography. A tungsten microelectrode is inserted into
            the nerve, and signals are rectified and integrated over
            time to obtain a mean voltage of sympathetic nerve activity.
            This is usually expressed burst frequency.(Mano, Iwase, &
            Toma, 2006; Park et al., 2017; Wallin & Fagius, 1988)

2.  Chemical measurements

    1.  Baroreceptor reflex

        1.  Gold standard method is through the Modified Oxford
            technique. MSNA and RR interval are measured during arterial
            BP changes induced through nitroprusside and
            phenylephrine.(Rudas et al., 1999)

    2.  Catecholamines

Heart rate variability measurements
-----------------------------------

1.  Relevance of HRV

    1.  Heart rate variability is the measurement of overall autonomic
        outflow after modulation. Historically, the largest prospective
        study, ATRAMI, showed reduced BRS and HRV led to worse outcomes
        after MI.(La Rovere, Bigger, Marcus, Mortara, & Schwartz, 1998)
        The varied changes in RR intervals, measured through HRV through
        different methods, suggest that factors that influence HRV and
        thus the sinus node, are autonomic in etiology.(Saul, 1990)

    2.  As the autonomic system has supramedullary inputs, HRV may index
        emotional landscape and psychosocial stress.(Thayer &
        Lane, 2000) And as HRV associates with overall cardiovascular
        mortality, it may be related to the effect on autonomic
        imbalance on mortality.(Thayer, Yamamoto, & Brosschot, 2010)

    3.  Reflects cardiac autonomic regulation although the contributions
        of parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems are
        unknown.(Billman, 2011; Task Force of the ESC and NAS, 1996)

    4.  Improvement in HRV occurs after cardiac rehabilitation, in line
        with improvement in functional status.(Jelinek, Huang,
        Khandoker, Chang, & Kiat, 2013)

2.  Measurement techniques

    1.  Geometric domain

        1.  SDNN over 24 hour hours, when decreased after MI, had
            increased mortality.(Kleiger, Miller, Bigger, & Moss, 1987)

    2.  Frequency domain

        1.  Power spectral analysis can be broken down into 4
            categories, ULF, VLF, LF, HF, and correspond to different
            cardiac sympathovagal balance (HF = RSA/vagal, LF = SNS, VLF
            = RAAS).(Akselrod et al., 1981)

        2.  After MI, LF was higher and HF was lower than in controls.
            HF "vagal tone" is reduced after MI but normalizes over the
            following year.(Lombardi et al., 1987)

        3.  Unclear the role of each frequency band, as LF may not be an
            adequate measure of sympathetic activity.(Houle &
            Billman, 1999) The LF/HF ratio may also not represent
            sympathovagal balance.(Billman, 2013)

    3.  Non-linear domain

        1.  Non-linear HRV uses the relationship between RR(n) and
            RR(n+1) to analyze heart rate dynamics. The
            multipole/Poincaré method results in *Dyx*, which is shown
            to be a prognostic marker in patients s/p myocardial
            infarction.(Jørgensen et al., 2016, 2015; Olesen et
            al., 2005)

3.  Considerations

    1.  Heart rate and HRV are not independent, but the relationship can
        be adjusted for mathematically.(J. Sacha, 2014)

    2.  Gender plays a significant role in HRV, and men and women cannot
        be compared easily.(J. Sacha et al., 2014)

Impact of stress-related disorders on autonomic function and cardiovascular disease
===================================================================================

Physiological influence of stress-related disorders
---------------------------------------------------

1.  Relationship of psychological stress with cardiovascular events

    1.  Early study looked at sudden death in factory workers -
        interview based data noted that a majority had been depressed
        prior to the event, and were acutely precipitated by arousal
        (anxiety, anger, increased work stress), suggesting that abrupt
        psychological changes leads to disharmonious responses.(Greene,
        Goldstein, & Moss, 1972)

    2.  Finland study with life stress and CHD (MI n=279, SCD n=226),
        showed both populations had recent life stress in prior 6
        months, but even more strongly in those with SCD.(Rahe, Bennett,
        Romo, Siltanen, & Arthur, 1973)

    3.  Anecdotally stress and anger events precede MI. Interviewing
        n=1623 patients right after MI showed that anger occurred 2
        hours prior had a RR=2.3, which was reduced in those taking
        aspirin but mechanism unknown.(Mittleman et al., 1995)

2.  Pathophysiological changes

    1.  In normal hearts, in the setting of monkeys on high-cholesterol
        diet, psychosocial stress led to endothelial damage, which was
        limited by the administration of B1-blockers.(Strawn et
        al., 1991)

    2.  Type A behavior traits compared to type B behavior traits had
        significantly more coronary calcification.(Sparagon et
        al., 2001)

    3.  In mice model, chronic social stress leads to increased
        sympathetic tone (based on geometric HRV), decreased circadian
        rhythm, and myocardial fibrosis.(Costoli, 2004) This compares
        with the concept of chronic psychosocial stress through human
        development, as the increased allostatic load leads to worse
        cardiovascular outcomes.(Danese & McEwen, 2012)

    4.  Insular cortex may mediate the sympathetic tone that leads to
        myocardial injury, such as seen in Takotsubo
        cardiomyopathy.(Nagai et al., 2017)

Post-traumatic stress disorder
------------------------------

1.  Clinical

    1.  PTSD can be diagnosed by SCID.(First, Michael B., Spitzer,
        Robert L, Gibbon Miriam, and Williams, 1996)

    2.  Characterized by emotional/mental stress after trauma, sx
        include hyperarousal, flashbacks/nightmares, intrusive thoughts

    3.  Health consequences are multi-organ, including cardiovascular
        risk even after adjustment for other factors.(Boscarino,
        1997, 2008)

2.  Autonomic mechanism

    1.  Angiotensin II may mediate some of the sympathetic activity, and
        thus some of the increased CVD risk.(Reid, 1992) ![Marvar
        explanation of PTSD and sympathetic
        activity](media/image4.png){width="3.7178937007874016in"
        height="1.9629625984251968in"}

    2.  PTSD leads to higher resting HR and BP, and was dependent on
        chronicity of PTSD.(Buckley & Kaloupek, 2001) Increased
        nocturnal SNS dominance has been seen, changing diurnal sleeping
        ANS function.(Muraoka, Carlson, & Chemtob, 1998)

    3.  Baroreflexes are also reduced in patients with PTSD, included
        blunted changes in HR and greater orthostasis.(Hughes, Dennis, &
        Beckham, 2007; Peckerman et al., 2003)

    4.  Reduced/blunted BRS and increased MSNA occur during mental
        stress in PTSD than controls.(Park et al., 2017)

    5.  PTSD had inversely related with VLF and LF, even after
        adjustment for other risk factors.(Shah et al., 2013)

3.  Cardiovascular risk

    1.  Double the CHD in veteran twin pairs discordant for
        PTSD.(Vaccarino et al., 2013) Increased CAC scores independent
        of risk factors in PTSD veterans.(Ahmadi et al., 2011) PTSD
        particularly in women have a significantly higher incidence of
        CHD.(Vaccarino & Bremner, 2017)

Depressive disorders
--------------------

1.  Clinical

    1.  Depression is prevalent in the US, affecting roughly 1/6
        adults.(Kessler, Chiu, Demler, & Walters, 2005) It also is
        associated with cardiovascular events.(Carney & Freedland, 2017)

    2.  Can be measured in severity through Beck Depression
        Inventory.(Beck, Steer, & Carbin, 1988)

    3.  Relationship may be bidirectional, as mental disorders including
        depressive episodes and dysthymia can develop after CAD.(Schaich
        et al., 2018)

2.  Autonomic mechanism

    1.  Depression coexsits with coronary heart disease, increases poor
        prognosis. Physiologically represents chronic, severe
        stress.(Carney & Freedland, 2017)

    2.  When depression is studied by HRV, the relationship appears
        bidirectional, but more heavily that autonomic dysfunction
        affects depression risk more than the converse.(Huang et
        al., 2018)

    3.  After ACS, HRV is decreased over 24-hour ECG monitoring in
        patients with depression than those without.(Carney et
        al., 2001)

    4.  Depression is related to decreased HRV in both clinical and
        non-clinical populations.(Paniccia, Paniccia, Thomas, Taha, &
        Reed, 2017) Thought to be partially due to prefrontal cortex
        hypoactivity, which possibly contributes to vagal
        withdrawal.(Sgoifo, Carnevali, Pico Alfonso, & Amore, 2015)

    5.  Decreases in HF HRV in depression is associated with suicidal
        ideation, even after adjustment of depression, anxiety, and
        stress.(Adolph, Teismann, Forkmann, Wannemüller, &
        Margraf, 2018)

    6.  Mechanism of lower HRV and depression is partially influenced by
        underlying biological pathway

3.  Cardiovascular risk

    1.  Increased cardiovascular risk occurs independently with onset of
        depression for decades after diagnosis.(Ford et al., 1998)

    2.  First ever depressive episode after ACS led to a OR of 2.6 for
        recurrent cardiac event.(Ossola, Gerra, Panfilis, Tonna, &
        Marchesi, 2018)

Anxiety disorder
----------------

1.  Clinical

2.  Autonomic mechanism

    1.  Anxiety is related to decreased HRV in both clinical and
        non-clinical populations.(Paniccia et al., 2017)

    2.  In anxious depression, higher pretreatment HRV had better
        outcomes, while in non-anxious depression lower pretreatment HRV
        had better outcomes.

    3.  Reduced HRV seen in all major psychiatric disorders.(Alvares,
        Quintana, Hickie, & Guastella, 2016)

3.  Cardiovascular risk

    1.  Anxiety may have an opposing effect to depression after ACS,
        being weakly protective in those who did not develop incidental
        depression.(Ossola et al., 2018)

Cardiovascular risk
===================

Mental stress
-------------

1.  Vasomotor response

    1.  In patients with CAD, increased vasomotor tone during
        mental-stress associates with increased activation in the insula
        and parietal cortex.(Shah et al., 2018)

    2.  Women have higher peripheral arterial tone during mental stress,
        but lower reactive hyperemia index after mental stress which
        suggests microvascular dysfunction, with doubled the rate of
        MSIMI than in men..\[Vaccarino2018\]

2.  Brain correlates

    1.  Stress-induced vasoreactivity leads to changes in brain
        responses during mental stress in patients with CAD.(Shah et
        al., 2018)

    2.  MSIMI associated with activation in brain areas involving
        autonomic regulation (left insula activation, and right
        precentral, postcentral, and temporal gyrus).(Bremner et
        al., 2018)

Gender differences
------------------

1.  Differences in myocardial ischemia

    1.  Unclear etiology of differences in ischemia, with older studies
        finding anginal stories and ischemic changes, but without
        consistent catherization data for plaque.(Glancy et al., 1971)

    2.  Depressive disorders after CAD are predicted by female gender
        and younger age.(Schaich et al., 2018)

    3.  Women have higher peripheral arterial tone during mental stress,
        but lower reactive hyperemia index after mental stress which
        suggests microvascular dysfunction, with doubled the rate of
        MSIMI than in men..\[Vaccarino2018\]

    4.  For those with suspected or established CAD, depression
        increases the risk of death, particularly in women.(Shah et
        al., 2014)

2.  Stress-related mental disorders

    1.  Increased risk of PTSD and depression in women than in men,
        which may lead to more vulnerability to cardiovascular disease
        than in men.(Vaccarino & Bremner, 2017)

    2.  Women and men have differences in cardiovascular responses to
        MSIMI, such that women have more peripheral vasoconstriction,
        while men have increased hemodynamic workload.(Sullivan et
        al., 2018)

    3.  Women with CAD are also more susceptible to MSIMI.(Vaccarino et
        al., 2016)

Treatment and behavioral modification
-------------------------------------

1.  Biofeedback

    1.  HRV biofeedback is a self-regulation of a "dysregulated" vagal
        nerve, thought to help with management of mental-health
        disease.(Blase, Dijke, Cluitmans, & Vermetten, 2010)

    2.  Mindfulness training reduces subjective feelings of depression
        after ACS.(Lundgren, Garvin, Kristenson, Jonasson, &
        Thylén, 2018)

    3.  Meditation also increases HRV and has brain correlates with
        changes in the anterior cingulate gyrus and hippocampus.(Tang et
        al., 2009)

2.  Medications

    1.  Antidepressants

        1.  T wave amplitude and QTc length did not change in patients
            with depression or anxiety on TCA, SSRI, SNRI.

        2.  Initial studies with SSRI showed it is safe in MI, but also
            showed trend of better overall functioning.(Glassman et
            al., 2002)

        3.  After ACS, SSRI shows decreased MACE in long-term followup
            (median 8 years).(Kim et al., 2018)

        4.  TCA however show a further decrease in HRV in patients with
            anxiety or mood disorders, while the data on SSRI and SNRI
            is much more mixed.(Alvares et al., 2016) SSRI seem to
            increase HRV in patients with depression.(Kidwell &
            Ellenbroek, 2018)

3.  Other

    1.  Vagal nerve stimulation reduces depression symptoms, but unknown
        effects on cardiovascular risk.(Kidwell & Ellenbroek, 2018)
