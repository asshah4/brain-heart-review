1. Neurobiological mechanisms and modulators
	1. Autonomic dysfunction
		- **component of HRV**
1. Genetic, epigenetic mechanisms
	1. Familial and twin studies
		- depression shows decreases in HRV [@Kidwell2018; @Carney2001b; @Paniccia2017], may be bidirectional [@Huang2018]
		- PTSD had inversely related with VLF and LF, even after adjustment for other risk factors.[@Shah2013]
	1. Epidemiological studies
		- For those with suspected or established CAD, depression increases the risk of death, particularly in women.[@Shah2014]
1. Preventative and treatment considerations
	1. Management of PTSD
		- **Mobile health and HRV**
			1. Heart rate variability
				1. Overview
					- summary of HRV, basic concepts of sinus node, NN intervals (e.g. sinus node, modulators) [@TaskForceoftheESCandNAS1996; @Shaffer2017]
				1. Measurement domains
					- geometric domain, frequency domain and clinical meaning [@Akselrod1981], non-linear domain and *Dyx* [@Lewkowicz2002; @Olesen2005]
				1. Controversy
					- correlation to autonomic tone is indirect [@Saul1990; @Goldstein2011; @Billman2013; @ReyesdelPaso2013]
					- measurement biases based on heart rate [@Sacha2014], and different by biological sex [@Sacha2014a]
