# Introduction
1. Summary
	- clinical/preclinical evidence for mechanisms of brain-heart interaction in stress disorders
	- neurological, psychiatric, genetic influences on autonomic dysfunction, atherosclerosis, ischemia
	- stress disorders including clinical (PD, PTSD, GAD, SAD, MDD) and allostatic load have relationship with cardiovascular risk
1. Key elements and hypothesis
	- autonomic dysfunction increases risk of arrhythmia
		- poor vasomotor response through sympathovagal balance
		- ischemia predisposes to arrhythmia
	- psychosocial stress leads to endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis
	- psychosocial stress increases autonomic dysfunction
	- autonomic dysfunction predisposes susceptibility to psychosocial stress 

# Historical context
1. Epidemiology studies
	- observational studies show that psychosocial stress, arousal, depression precipitate SCD [@Greene1972; @Rahe1973; @Mittleman1995]
1. Neurophysiology 
	1. Neurocardiac axis 
		- description of anatomical pathways (medullary, supramedullary, intrathoracic extracardiac ganglia, intrinsic cardiac ganglia, spinal columns) [@Armour2008; @Oppenheimer1992]
		- importance of sympathetic tone through stellate ganglion for increasing risk of VF [@Kliks1975; @Schwartz1977a; @Harris1971], and that of vagal activity as protective [@Kolman1975; @Rabinowitz1976; @Ng2001; @Brack2007; @Brack2011; @Coote2013]
	1. Arrhythmia studies
		- brain stimulation by chemical/electrical stimuli lead to VF [@Levy1914; @Lown1977]; threshold lowered with ischemia [@Kolman1975]; dysrhythmia mediated potentially through catecholamines [@Davis1993]
		- psychological stress can also lead to fibrillation [@Lown1973]

# Neurobiological considerations
1. Further relevant neurocardiac anatomy
1. HPA axis
1. Neuropeptides
	1. RAAS
		- angiotensin II impact on BRS suggests it amplifies the cardiovascular response to SNS [@Reid1992]
1. Immune dysfunction

# Experimental measurement tools
1. Biomarkers 
	- endothelial dysfunction
	- progenitor cells
1. Multiunit postganglionic sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA)
	1. Overview
		- summary of methods of microneurography [@Park2017; @Mano2006; @Wallin1988]
	1. Clinical utility
1. Heart rate variability
	1. Overview
		- summary of HRV, basic concepts of sinus node, NN intervals (e.g. sinus node, modulators) [@TaskForceoftheESCandNAS1996; @Shaffer2017]
	1. Measurement domains
		- geometric domain, frequency domain and clinical meaning [@Akselrod1981], non-linear domain and *Dyx* [@Lewkowicz2002; @Olesen2005]
	1. Controversy
		- correlation to autonomic tone is indirect [@Saul1990; @Goldstein2011; @Billman2013; @ReyesdelPaso2013]
		- measurement biases based on heart rate [@Sacha2014], and different by biological sex [@Sacha2014a]
1. Baroreceptor reflex sensitivity 
	- modified oxford technique [@Rudas1999];
1. Neuroimaging
	- mental stress changes can identify brain areas involved in autonomic regulation [@Bremner2018]
1. Vasomotor tone

# Autonomic dysfunction
1. Importance of autonomic dysfunction on cardiovascular risk
	- increased mortality after MI with decreased SDNN [@Kleiger1987], with decreased HRV/BRS in ATRAMI [@LaRovere1998], and with decreased *Dyx* [@Jørgensen2016; @Jørgensen2015]
		- increased sympathetic tone is potentially cardiotoxic [@Nagai2017]
	- sympathovagal balance occurs after MI although normalizes with time [@Lombardi1987; @Lombardi1992], however difficult to measure/interpret [@Billman2013; @ReyesdelPaso2013]
1. Cardiovascular disease impacting autonomic tone
	- decreases in HRV seen after ischemia [@Houle1999; @Stein2005; @Akselrod1981], but potentially may occur beforehand [@Dekker2000; @Goldkorn2015]
	- decreases in HRV can predict SCD, CAD, MACE [@Chyun2015; @Maheshwari2016; Valencia2013; @Liao1997; @Tsuji1994; @Pop-Busui2010]
1. Relationship of stress/anxiety disorders
	1. Chronic stress and vital exhaustion
		- chronic stress can lead to endothelial damage/dysfunction and increased sympathetic tone [@Strawn1991; @Costoli2004; @Danese2012; @Sparagon2001], including comorbid conditions such as HTN [@Su2015]
		- vital exhaustion leads to increased SCD/MACE [@Cené2012; @Williams2010; @Vroege2012]
	1. Depression
		- depression shows decreases in HRV [@Kidwell2018; @Carney2001b; @Paniccia2017], may be bidirectional [@Huang2018]
		- cardiac outcomes are worse with depression [@Carney2017; @Ford1998; @Ossola2018; @Carney2001b], but depression and low HRV also has increased suicidality [@Adolph2018]
		- mediated potentially through prefrontal cortex hypoactivity and vagal withdrawal [@Sgoifo2015]
	1. Anxiety disorders
		- PTSD leads to increased cardiovascular risk independently [@Boscarino1997; @Boscarino2008; @Vaccarino2013; @Ahmadi2011]
		- HR/BP increased in PTSD [@Buckley2001], BRS also reduced in PTSD [@Peckerman2003; @Hughes2007], with increased MSNA and decreased HRV [@Park2017; @Shah2013; @Muraoka1998] 
		- inflammation may mediate the cardiovascular risk [@Brudey2015]
		- anxiety shows decreases in HRV, but those with higher HRV had better symptom control [@Paniccia2017]; all major psychiatric disorders have decreased HRV [@Alvares2016]

# Genetic and epigenetic findings
1. Familial and twin studies 
	- some psychiatric stressors, like depression, show a genetic/biologic basis [@Vaccarino2008]
	- PTSD shows decreases in HRV and increases of CAD independent of genetic influences [@Vaccarino2013; @Shah2013]
1. Gender
	- differences seen in CAD and chest pain historically [@Glancy1971], but non-obstructive disease remains significant for mortality in women [@Xie2017]
	- depression and CAD are more prominent in women [@Schaich2018], but depression also increases mortality [@Shah2014], and increased risk of CAD in those with PTSD [@Vaccarino2017]
	- mental stress testing leads to different peripheral and coronary responses [@Vaccarino2017; @Vaccarino2016a; @Sullivan2018a; @Vaccarino2018]

# Prevention and Treatment
1. Behavioral modifications
	- biofeedback, mindfulness, meditation decrease symptom burden [@Blase2010; @Lundgren2018] 
		- have neurological and autonomic changes [@Tang2009]
	- cardiac rehabilitation also improves HRV [@Jelinek2013]
1. Pharmacological interventions
	1. Cardiovascular drugs
	1. Psychoactive drugs
		- SSRI treatment of depression decreases cardiovascular risk [@Glassman2002; @Kim2018; @Smolderen2017]
		- other TCA/SSRI/SNRI have only mild/moderate decreases in HRV compared to primary psychiatric disorders [@Alvares2016], and in depression SSRI may increase HRV [@Kidwell2018]
